       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So far, most of those infected with the virus — a type of coronavirus whose scientific designation is 2019-nCoV — have been in China. Most of the deaths have been there as well. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both the World Health Organization and the United States have declared public health emergencies, and both have offered China technical assistance and expertise to investigate and contain the outbreak.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much is still unknown about the virus, including two factors that are pivotal to predicting the global human toll: how easily the virus spreads from person to person, and how many of those infected develop severe disease that can lead to death. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In late January, W.H.O. officials said that about 20 percent of reported patients in China had developed severe illness, including respiratory failure and pneumonia, and that about 2 percent had died. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But many infected people may have developed only mild symptoms and not sought medical care. That would mean the overall fatality rate could be considerably lower than 2 percent. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Experts cannot yet say who is at greatest risk for developing severe or life-threatening disease, and what factors may be protective against the illness. Children <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/health/coronavirus-children.html\" title=\"\">seem much less likely to develop severe illnesses</a> than middle-aged and older men. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The United States is barring entry by most foreign nationals who have recently visited China. Americans returning from Wuhan and Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, are to be quarantined for two weeks. </p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a very serious public health situation, and the C.D.C. and federal government have and will continue to take aggressive action to protect the public,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There are just a handful of cases in the United States, however, and for now the risk to Americans is low. </p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Coronaviruses are named for the spikes, which resemble a crown or the sun’s corona, that protrude from their surfaces. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. The infections can range from the common cold to dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html\" title=\"\">which sickened thousands of people around the world</a> — and killed nearly 800 — during an outbreak in 2003. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.</p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-332e2fc9\">How dangerous is it?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus, and some scientists said initially that the new virus appeared to be less severe than SARS or MERS. </p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But recent news reports indicate that the Chinese authorities muzzled doctors who were first to recognize the new infection, and they may not <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/china-coronavirus-censorship.html\" title=\"\">have been fully transparent about the number of infections and deaths</a> even after the alarm was raised. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is also not clear whether cases and deaths in China are being carefully tracked and reported. Diagnostic kits and other health resources <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html\" title=\"\">have been in short supply in the affected regions</a>. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists don’t know who is most susceptible to the new coronavirus. Does it pose a risk to young healthy people? Or, like seasonal flu, is it primarily a threat to the frail and elderly, and those with underlying health problems?</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Whenever a new virus comes out, it takes a while to learn about it,” said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>Right now, she said, “The information about coronavirus is changing rapidly.” </p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-4233383d\">How is the new coronavirus transmitted?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most respiratory viruses are transmitted through coughing and sneezing.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though the Chinese authorities initially played down the likelihood of human-to-human transmission, it has now become clear there is significant and sustained transmission among people. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chinese scientists have warned that some infected people may transmit the virus to others even before they develop illness or experience any symptoms, although a published report documenting asymptomatic transmission in Germany has been criticized as flawed.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If people with no symptoms at all or mild symptoms unrelated to respiratory illness — like headache or back ache — can transmit the virus, that’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” Dr. Schaffner said. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A major concern is that with both SARS and MERS, a few patients inexplicably became “superspreaders” who infected huge numbers of people. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Health care workers are particularly vulnerable. At a hospital in Seoul in 2015, one man with MERS transmitted it to 82 patients. </p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-525ab252\">Where did the new coronavirus outbreak start?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Jan. 8, The New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html\" title=\"\">identified a new coronavirus</a> as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cases were linked to a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. The market was later shut down and disinfected. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including SARS, also are believed to have emerged from live animal markets. The coronavirus that causes MERS is transmitted to humans by camels.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The animal that was the source of the new coronavirus is still not known, and the destruction of the Wuhan meat market has made the question nearly impossible to investigate. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html\" title=\"\">Bats are considered a possible source</a>, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, including coronaviruses. But it is very possible the virus was transmitted from bats to an intermediate animal, and then to humans.</p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-zd32qr\">Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-1uuihdo\">The virus has sickened more than 40,600 people in China and 24 other countries.</p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-5cda2f4b\">What symptoms should I look out for?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Symptoms of this virus include fever, severe cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. The incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be anywhere from 10 days to two weeks.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If you have a fever or cough and recently visited China, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so they can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.</p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-7c7b4f38\">Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? </h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There is a diagnostic test that can tell if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Right now, tests are done by the C.D.C. in Atlanta, but the test has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and will be distributed to state laboratories. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The main treatment for coronavirus is supportive care, including making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, Dr. Vaishampayan said. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Patients should rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">No drugs have been approved for any coronavirus diseases, including the new coronavirus, though an antiviral medication called remdesivir appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat a patient in Washington State. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chinese officials are experimenting with other antiviral drugs to treat the infection. </p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-b710cce\">How long will it take to develop a vaccine?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to move at unprecedented speed, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">are working on vaccine candidates</a>.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial may get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine is safe and effective. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even under the best circumstances, it could take at least a year — maybe longer — for a vaccine to become available.</p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-af8807b\">Should I wear a surgical mask to protect myself?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If you have a respiratory infection, wearing a mask <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/coronavirus-surgical-masks.html\" title=\"\">helps protect the people around you from illness</a> by reducing the risk that you will spread the infection. And wearing a surgical mask may somewhat protect you from infection in a crowd if there is an outbreak. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, generally, surgical masks are not closefitting enough to filter all the air you are breathing in, and heavy-duty N95 respirators are extremely uncomfortable.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Experts recommend <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-tips.html\" title=\"\">washing your hands frequently</a> throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the moment, the risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>“is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”</p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-6211b58\">I have a trip planned to China. Should I go?</h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Probably not. The State Department has warned Americans not to go to China unless it is absolutely essential.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If travelers must go, the C.D.C. urges enhanced precautions: avoiding contact with anyone who is sick, as well as with animals and the markets in which they are sold; and refraining from eating raw or undercooked meats. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Anyone who is older or has an underlying health condition, which increases susceptibility to infections, should consult with a health provider before making a trip. Access to medical care in China may be difficult, given the outbreak, and federal officials warned that new travel restrictions could be imposed on return, including quarantine.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many airlines have canceled flights to China, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/travel/coronavirus-travel-plans.html\" title=\"\">many travelers were left in limbo</a> while looking to change or cancel bookings.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span></p>,\n",
       " <h2 class=\"css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-755ffae6\">What are health authorities doing to contain the virus? </h2>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">China has taken drastic actions to bar people from leaving affected areas, though 5 million people departed Wuhan alone before the restrictions went into effect. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Residents have been told to wear masks in public to prevent the spread of the disease. Two new hospitals for coronavirus patients are being erected; the first opened on Monday. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers from China for signs of illness, and some have gone further,<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>barring entry to people from China. Russia and Mongolia have closed most of their borders with China. Australia said it would evacuate citizens from Wuhan and quarantine them for 14 days on Christmas Island.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">C.D.C. teams are also providing assistance with state health investigations of infections, including contact-tracing, which means making sure anyone who may have been in contact with an infected individual is warned of the exposure and<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>is monitored. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The work will enhance the understanding of the virus and how to prevent its spread. C.D.C. teams have also offered to send public health experts to China to help with the investigation and containment efforts.</p>,\n",

       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,” Dr. Gauden Galea, the W.H.O.’s representative to China, said in a statement.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many questions about the new virus remain. While it appears to be transmitted to humans via animals, the Chinese government has not said which animals, nor has it disclosed other details about the outbreak, like the transmission route, the incubation period or the ages and genders of the patients. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“So, there are still a lot of question marks,” said David Hui, an expert in emerging infections at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The authorities in Wuhan are still closely monitoring 163 people who were in close contact with the patients, Dr. Hui said. He added that 15 days, the minimum incubation period for some viral infections, had not yet passed since the last reported instance of the disease, on Dec. 29.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s premature to say that there’s no human-to-human transmission,” Dr. Hui said.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Wuhan government <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">confirmed on Dec. 31</a> that the health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. Symptoms of the new illness include high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions, according to the Wuhan health commission. Seven people have become critically ill, the Wuhan authorities have said. On Wednesday, the local health commission said eight people had been discharged.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Researchers have been encouraged by the fact that patients’ relatives and hospital workers have not been reported to have gotten sick, signaling that the virus may not spread easily among humans. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We can assume that this virus transmissibility is not that high,” said Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, who was part of a team that successfully identified the coronavirus that caused SARS.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Guan said he was not surprised that the virus identified was a coronavirus, because coronaviruses can pass from animals to humans easily. But he said it would probably be a while before researchers came up with treatments for the illness. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So far, the cases in China have circulated only in Wuhan. The initial cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. Workers disinfected and shut down the market after the city health department said many of the cases had been traced to it. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new illness appeared just weeks before the Spring Festival, China’s biggest holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel. The authorities have urged the public to be on alert for pneumonialike symptoms like fevers, body aches and breathing difficulties.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Until Thursday’s announcement, it was not clear what was causing the illnesses in Wuhan. The World Health Organization said Wednesday that it had concluded that it was most likely a coronavirus. “More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen,” the W.H.O. said in a statement. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Early reports on ProMED, a disease-alert service, said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last weekend, laboratory tests in China ruled out SARS; the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS; the flu; bird flu; adenoviruses; and other common pathogens that cause pneumonia.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Health officials in Asia have stepped up screenings and isolated patients with flulike symptoms who had traveled to Wuhan.<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>In Hong Kong, eight people with fever and respiratory symptoms who had recently been in Wuhan were hospitalized on Wednesday. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In South Korea, the authorities said on Wednesday that they had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3045249/chinese-worker-who-visited-wuhan-quarantined-south-korea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">put a Chinese woman under isolated treatment</a> after she was found to have pneumonia after trips to China, including Wuhan. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Singapore, the authorities placed a Chinese girl with pneumonia in isolation because she had traveled to Wuhan. On Sunday, they said doctors had determined that the child <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/update-on-local-situation-regarding-severe-pneumonia-cluster-in-wuhan-5-jan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">had a common childhood viral illness</a>.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials in Hong Kong have installed additional thermal imaging systems at its airport to monitor passengers coming from Wuhan, scanning for people with fevers.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">SARS is believed to have jumped to humans from live-animal markets. It was eventually traced to civet cats, raccoon dogs and some other species that were raised and slaughtered for the exotic food trade. The virus normally circulates in bats, and the animals may have gotten it from them, possibly by eating food contaminated by bat droppings.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most outbreaks of MERS, which appeared in 2012, have been traced to people who raise or sell camels, which in the Middle East are kept for meat, milk, racing, hauling cargo and as pets. Like SARS, MERS can jump from person to person, particularly in hospitals. Some MERS patients infected many others after they were put on machines to help them breathe — the mechanisms helped spew viral particles into the air as they exhaled.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite Thursday’s announcement, many Chinese were still expressing fear that there could be a repeat of SARS.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In fact, what people are more concerned about is the transmission route and whether it can be cured,” wrote a user on Weibo, a popular social media tool in China.</p>,\n",
