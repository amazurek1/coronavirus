But health officials in China and elsewhere are watching it carefully to ensure that the outbreak does not develop into something more severe. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Researchers in China have “initially identified” the new virus, a coronavirus, as the pathogen behind a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html" title="">mysterious, pneumonialike illness that has sickened 59 people in the city of Wuhan</a> and caused a panic in the central Chinese region, the state broadcaster, China Central Television, said on Thursday. They detected this virus in 15 of the people who fell ill, the report said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new coronavirus “is different from previous human coronaviruses that were previously discovered, and more scientific research is needed for further understanding,” the report said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. Some cause only the symptoms known as the common cold, although many other viruses also do that.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement signals that researchers are making progress in containing the outbreak, but Asian officials are not likely to relax their vigilance until they learn more. The disease has evoked memories of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html" title="">the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome</a>, in 2003. SARS, a respiratory disease and also a coronavirus, spread from southern China in 2003 and infected more than 3,000 people, killing 774. </p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know?

On Thursday, the World Health Organization praised the Chinese response to the new outbreak and said it did not recommend any restrictions on trade or travel to China because of the virus. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,” Dr. Gauden Galea, the W.H.O.’s representative to China, said in a statement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many questions about the new virus remain. While it appears to be transmitted to humans via animals, the Chinese government has not said which animals, nor has it disclosed other details about the outbreak, like the transmission route, the incubation period or the ages and genders of the patients. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“So, there are still a lot of question marks,” said David Hui, an expert in emerging infections at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities in Wuhan are still closely monitoring 163 people who were in close contact with the patients, Dr. Hui said. He added that 15 days, the minimum incubation period for some viral infections, had not yet passed since the last reported instance of the disease, on Dec. 29.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s premature to say that there’s no human-to-human transmission,” Dr. Hui said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wuhan government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">confirmed on Dec. 31</a> that the health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. Symptoms of the new illness include high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions, according to the Wuhan health commission. Seven people have become critically ill, the Wuhan authorities have said. On Wednesday, the local health commission said eight people had been discharged.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Researchers have been encouraged by the fact that patients’ relatives and hospital workers have not been reported to have gotten sick, signaling that the virus may not spread easily among humans. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We can assume that this virus transmissibility is not that high,” said Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, who was part of a team that successfully identified the coronavirus that caused SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Guan said he was not surprised that the virus identified was a coronavirus, because coronaviruses can pass from animals to humans easily. But he said it would probably be a while before researchers came up with treatments for the illness. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, the cases in China have circulated only in Wuhan. The initial cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. Workers disinfected and shut down the market after the city health department said many of the cases had been traced to it. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new illness appeared just weeks before the Spring Festival, China’s biggest holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel. The authorities have urged the public to be on alert for pneumonialike symptoms like fevers, body aches and breathing difficulties.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until Thursday’s announcement, it was not clear what was causing the illnesses in Wuhan. The World Health Organization said Wednesday that it had concluded that it was most likely a coronavirus. “More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen,” the W.H.O. said in a statement. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early reports on ProMED, a disease-alert service, said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last weekend, laboratory tests in China ruled out SARS; the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS; the flu; bird flu; adenoviruses; and other common pathogens that cause pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials in Asia have stepped up screenings and isolated patients with flulike symptoms who had traveled to Wuhan.<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>In Hong Kong, eight people with fever and respiratory symptoms who had recently been in Wuhan were hospitalized on Wednesday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In South Korea, the authorities said on Wednesday that they had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3045249/chinese-worker-who-visited-wuhan-quarantined-south-korea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">put a Chinese woman under isolated treatment</a> after she was found to have pneumonia after trips to China, including Wuhan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Singapore, the authorities placed a Chinese girl with pneumonia in isolation because she had traveled to Wuhan. On Sunday, they said doctors had determined that the child <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/update-on-local-situation-regarding-severe-pneumonia-cluster-in-wuhan-5-jan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">had a common childhood viral illness</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials in Hong Kong have installed additional thermal imaging systems at its airport to monitor passengers coming from Wuhan, scanning for people with fevers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS is believed to have jumped to humans from live-animal markets. It was eventually traced to civet cats, raccoon dogs and some other species that were raised and slaughtered for the exotic food trade. The virus normally circulates in bats, and the animals may have gotten it from them, possibly by eating food contaminated by bat droppings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most outbreaks of MERS, which appeared in 2012, have been traced to people who raise or sell camels, which in the Middle East are kept for meat, milk, racing, hauling cargo and as pets. Like SARS, MERS can jump from person to person, particularly in hospitals. Some MERS patients infected many others after they were put on machines to help them breathe — the mechanisms helped spew viral particles into the air as they exhaled.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite Thursday’s announcement, many Chinese were still expressing fear that there could be a repeat of SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In fact, what people are more concerned about is the transmission route and whether it can be cured,” wrote a user on Weibo, a popular social media tool in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Sui-Lee Wee reported from Hong Kong and Donald G.

The woman is in good and stable condition, said a spokesman for Thailand’s public health ministry, Rungrueng Kitphati.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman entered Thailand through Bangkok via a flight from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html" title="">the epicenter of the outbreak</a>. Investigators were still trying to gather information from the woman but have been hindered by a language barrier, Mr. Rungrueng said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, Japan’s Health Ministry said that a Chinese man in his 30s tested positive for the coronavirus. The man, a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo, returned to Japan on Jan. 6 after traveling to Wuhan.

But, he said, the health authorities were waiting for laboratory results to confirm that the woman is free of the coronavirus before discharging her. She said that she wanted to do some sightseeing after she leaves the hospital, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The revelation that neither the patient in Japan nor the first one found in Thailand had visited the Huanan Seafood Market, to which most of the cases have been linked, is a troubling sign that the outbreak could be spreading in Wuhan. The market was shut down and disinfected on Jan. 1, but new cases have appeared since, suggesting the virus has not been eradicated. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Concerns have grown across the region since the Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of the mysterious new virus, which has sickened dozens of people in Wuhan with pneumonialike symptoms. The city’s health commission said on Wednesday that the risk<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>of human-to-human transmission is low but possible.

While flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now, many in China are skeptical.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The local authorities in Wuhan and the W.H.O. have reiterated for weeks that no cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, researchers in China said they had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html" title="">“initially identified”</a><span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind the mysterious respiratory<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html" title=""> illness</a>. Of the 40 cases diagnosed in Wuhan, the majority of patients are middle-age and older men, the city’s health commission said on Wednesday.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Five people are in critical condition, officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two deaths have been reported in China, both in Wuhan: a 69-year-old man who fell ill on New Year’s Eve and died Wednesday, and a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-death.html" title="">61-year-old man</a> who died last week and had previously been diagnosed with abdominal tumors and liver disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The most recent case in China was detected on Jan. 3. The minimum incubation period for some viral infections is 15 days, suggesting that it could be a few more days before the authorities are able to determine the full extent of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That timeline has fueled concerns among governments across the region, especially ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins next week. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">Hundreds of millions of people in China<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>are expected to travel</a> during the holiday. Thailand expects more than 300,000 Chinese visitors during the holiday, according to local tourism officials.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and South Korea have taken precautionary measures, quarantining patients with flulike symptoms and increasing temperature screenings at their airports. Japan said it was investigating who the patient there had been in contact with since he returned from China and has asked people who experience symptoms to report them. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the new coronavirus appears to be less virulent and deadly than SARS, many questions remain, including the source of the virus and its transmission route. Infectious disease experts say the source is very likely to be a mammal because coronaviruses spread easily from mammals to humans. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. Symptoms of different coronaviruses can include those that resemble the common cold, influenza or pneumonia. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s no need to panic but I think there needs to be an urgency to address these questions,” said Dr. Peiris of the University of Hong Kong. “The problem is that most of these animals are illegally sold, so that might not be so easy to do.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Peiris said he was encouraged that there were no cases of hospital workers falling ill, reducing the likelihood of a widespread outbreak within the community, as there had been with SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, said he was also reassured that the Wuhan government had not reported any new cases in recent days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If there are no new cases in the next few days, the outbreak is over,” said Dr. Guan, who was part of a team that successfully identified the coronavirus that caused SARS. </p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Eimi Yamamitsu contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono from Bangkok.

It is not certain that the virus spreads from person to person.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But a few cases have not been linked to animals, and researchers say some human-to-human transmission may be possible.

The first flight to be screened will arrive at New York’s Kennedy International Airport on Friday night, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the C.D.C.’s division of global migration and quarantine, said at a news briefing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">J.F.K. is the only airport in New York where the screening will take place. Screenings at San Francisco International and Los Angeles International will begin on Saturday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 60,000 to 65,000 people a year travel to the United States from Wuhan. Over the next few weeks, some 5,000 passengers are likely to be checked for signs of the new infection, Dr. Cetron said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only New York and San Francisco receive direct flights from Wuhan; passengers arriving in Los Angeles are on connecting flights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Travelers will be asked to fill out questionnaires asking if they have symptoms like a cough or a fever, and whether they have visited meat and seafood markets in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Screeners will also use thermal scanners that can be pointed at the forehead or temple to look for fever. People with signs of illness will be examined further, along with family members or others traveling with them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those who seem likely to be infected with the virus will be sent to area hospitals for further testing and treatment. Dr. Cetron said hospitals in each city had been designated to handle possible cases, but declined to name them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It may not be easy to identify likely cases at airports, because the flu season is well underway, and winter is the peak period for common colds and other respiratory viruses that can cause coughing, fever and runny noses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The screening could take time, Dr. Cetron said, and some passengers may miss connecting flights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The illness was first reported in late December in Wuhan, in central China. Fears of a more widespread outbreak arose when two cases were found in Thailand and one in Japan, apparently carried to those countries by air travelers from Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The disease is caused by a coronavirus, a member of a family of viruses that can cause respiratory ailments ranging from colds to pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A different coronavirus caused the SARS outbreak that began in 2003. It originated in China and was spread to other countries by travelers, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That virus is also believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets selling meat, poultry and sometimes live animals like civets. SARS turned out to be highly contagious among humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A coronavirus is also the cause of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">MERS, another severe respiratory ailment</a> that has been present in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries since 2012.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The MERS virus is carried by camels, and most cases have resulted from contact with the animals, but infected people can spread it to one another. The death rate is high, from 30 percent to 40 percent of patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new coronavirus appears to cause a less serious illness than SARS or MERS. But Dr. Cetron and Dr. Messonnier warned that the infection is new, little is known about it and the situation is rapidly evolving.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Humility is important,” Dr. Cetron said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The severity of SARS and MERS puts health officials on high alert when dealing with new coronaviruses, Dr. Messonnier said. If the virus is jumping from animals to humans for the first time — which may be the case in the current outbreak — people almost certainly have no immunity to it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whether the new coronavirus is contagious among people is not clear. The best treatment is not known, and there is no vaccine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It doesn’t take much for a virus in general to go from being worrisome to being extremely worrisome, because they tend to morph and mutate a lot,” Dr. Messonnier said.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

One new case was also reported in South Korea on Monday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The jump in cases raised questions about how the virus is being transmitted and added to concerns about the spread of the illness ahead of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">China’s busiest travel season</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health commission in Wuhan, a central Chinese city where the virus originated last month, said early Monday that 136 new cases had been detected on Saturday and Sunday, including one who died.

On Tuesday, the authorities confirmed a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020012109083" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fourth death</a> from the illness in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities had previously said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">the deadly virus</a> seemed capable of spreading only from animals to humans in most cases, tracing the outbreak to a market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in recent days at least two people have become infected with the pneumonialike virus even though they live hundreds of miles from Wuhan, experts said on Monday, suggesting that the illness is spreading from person to person.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission phenomenon,” Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who is leading a government-appointed expert panel on the outbreak, said in an interview on state-run television on Monday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization announced Monday that it was convening an emergency meeting on Wednesday “to ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Millions of Chinese are traveling this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, adding to fears that the virus could spread swiftly and on a broader scale. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would now depend on how many people, on average, a person with virus could infect.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are now sufficient cases that it’s not going to die out by chance,” said Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College London who has studied the new virus. “The real question now is, how efficiently can this virus spread from person to person?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said on Monday that the outbreak “must be taken seriously” and that every possible measure should be taken to contain it, according to the state broadcaster CCTV.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also on Monday, the authorities reported that new cases had been detected for the first time in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern province of Guangdong, all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. In many of these cases, people infected with the virus had traveled to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here is what we know about the virus, where it has been found, how it is spreading and what precautions are being taken:</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-1cc6a8ba">The virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government of Wuhan <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html" title="">first confirmed on Dec. 31</a> that hospitals in the city were treating dozens of patients for pneumonia with an unknown cause.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of the cases were connected to the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. Considered a likely source of the virus, the market was closed and disinfected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that the illness had also appeared in people who had not been exposed to the market, raising the possibility that the virus could be present elsewhere in the city.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Local officials have pledged to handle the outbreak with transparency. But the memory of how China initially covered up the extent of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html" title="">a deadly SARS outbreak</a> that infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003 has not completely faded. Although flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now, many in China remain skeptical.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the weekend, the number of reported cases <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-coronavirus.html" title="">more than tripled to about 200</a>, mostly in Wuhan. One more person in the city died, bringing the total death toll to three, while nine others remained critically ill, the city’s health commission said. Twenty-five people have recovered.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities have started detecting the country’s first cases outside of Wuhan. Five new cases were reported in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong Province, and two in Shanghai. The total number of cases climbed to at least 219.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization said the spike in reported cases was the result of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1219026530636091392" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">increased searching and testing</a> for respiratory illnesses.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-4b7c1708">The virus now appears to spread between humans.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Researchers in China <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html" title="">identified the mysterious pneumonialike illness</a> in early January as a new coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts initially said that it did not appear to be readily spread by humans, but on Monday Dr. Zhong, the scientist appointed by the government to study the outbreak, said that in Guangdong, two individuals appeared to have been infected by relatives who had traveled to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Zhong said the virus could be present in particles of saliva. In one case, he said, a patient appears to have infected 14 medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, like the sun’s corona. Such viruses cause several illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like SARS. Dr. Zhong was China’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/health/after-its-epidemic-arrival-sars-vanishes.html" title="">leading SARS expert</a> during that outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">to the World Health Organization</a>, common signs of infection include fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties like shortness of breath. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-9f16ce7">Cases have been reported outside China.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-china.html" title="">authorities in Thailand detected the new coronavirus</a> last week in two Chinese women who had flown from Wuhan to Bangkok on separate trips. The government said the women, aged 74 and 61, were in good condition.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Japan, a Chinese man who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 was also confirmed to have the disease. He was discharged after five days in a hospital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">South Korea confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on Monday in a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived on Sunday at Incheon International Airport, which serves Seoul.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman was found with a fever, muscle pain and other symptoms while going through customs and was immediately quarantined for tests, said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman was traveling with five other people intending to spend the Lunar New Year holidays in South Korea and Japan, Ms. Jung said. South Korean officials were running tests on anyone believed to have come in contact with the woman in the plane, she said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-44fceb74">Officials have implemented precautionary measures.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Hong Kong, the government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202001/04/P2020010400179.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">initiated a disease response plan</a> after the first cases were reported in Wuhan. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dozens of people were hospitalized</a> after returning to Hong Kong from mainland China, but none were found to have been infected with the new virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Five people who traveled from Wuhan to Zhejiang, a coastal Chinese province south of Shanghai, are being treated for fever but have not been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, the health authorities there said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">State media also reported six suspected cases on Monday, including two in Sichuan Province, one in Shanghai, one in Yunnan Province, one in Shandong Province and one in the region of Guangxi.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the southern city of Shenzhen, the authorities have started imposing temperature screening procedures at the airport and at train and bus stations. The city said it would also crack down on the illegal trading of wild animals.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-32956296">Animals appear to be the most likely source.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The W.H.O. says animals appear to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak, though it is still not known which animals are responsible.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, like SARS, were believed to have emerged from markets where people and live animals were in regular contact.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To prevent the spread of respiratory infections, the W.H.O. recommends that people wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing, and avoid direct contact with farm or wild animals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health authorities in Hong Kong <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">have also advised residents</a> traveling outside the city not to touch live animals, not to eat wild animals, and to avoid markets selling fresh meat and live poultry.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Javier C. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/javier-c-hernandez" title="">Hernández</a> reported from Wuhan and Austin Ramzy reported from Hong Kong.

This was the capital today. </strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington to honor the civil rights leader’s federal holiday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the House impeachment managers and the president’s defense team took turns touring the Senate chamber and surrounding offices, transformed into a court for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/us/politics/trump-legal-team-asks-senate-for-speedy-acquittal-in-impeachment-trial.html" title="">the nation’s third-ever impeachment trial</a>, which opens Tuesday with a debate on rules for the proceedings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump’s legal team called on the Senate to “swiftly reject” the impeachment charges and acquit him, arguing that Democrats would “permanently weaken the presidency” if they succeeded in removing him from office over what the team characterized as policy and political differences.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. Thousands of pro-gun advocates,</strong> many of them armed, converged in Virginia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They gathered outside the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, most in an area where guns were allowed, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/us/virginia-gun-rally.html" title="">to oppose a series of gun-control measures being considered in the State Legislature</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite fears of potential violence, as of this writing there were no official reports of skirmishes or major incidents among the 22,000 in attendance, with 16,000 outside the perimeter and 6,000 inside.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was like a family gathering,” said one protester who drove from Texas to participate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The State Senate last week approved three gun control bills, which the House of Delegates could approve as early as this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. A united front for Democrats.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several Democratic presidential candidates — including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — put aside their recent sparring and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/us/politics/democratic-candidates-mlk-day.html" title="">marched arm in arm through the streets of South Carolina’s capital</a> to honor Dr. King.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Former Vice President Joe Biden has a strong lead in South Carolina polls and is widely favored among black voters. His rivals didn’t take him on directly but sought to make the case to African-Americans about how the next president could benefit their interests.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the march, most of the candidates headed to an Iowa forum focused on minority communities, a scant two weeks before the state caucuses there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4. A deadly Boeing 737 crash in 2009</strong> held lessons that were never learned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Documents and interviews show that the Dutch Safety Board either <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/business/boeing-737-accidents.html" title="">excluded or played down criticisms of the plane manufacturer</a> in its final report on a crash near Amsterdam, after pushback from a team of Americans that included Boeing and federal safety officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The muted criticism fits within a broader pattern, brought to light since the more recent 737 Max tragedies, of how the company has benefited from a light touch by safety officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the 2009 crash and the Max accidents, the failure of a single sensor caused systems to misfire, and Boeing had not provided pilots with information that could have helped them react to the malfunction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. Just don’t call it climate change.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">States that apply for billions of dollars in a federal natural-disaster program must first explain why they need the money. And <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/climate/climate-change-funding-states.html" title="">some conservative states feel compelled to avoid mentioning climate change</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A 306-page draft proposal from Texas — hit by Hurricane Harvey, above, in 2017 — doesn’t use the term, nor does South Carolina’s. Louisiana includes it in an appendix on the final page.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are exceptions, like Florida. “Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards,” state officials wrote in their application.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6. Disposable plastic’s new enemy: China.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government introduced measures to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/world/asia/china-plastic.html" title="">drastically cut the amount of disposable plastic items</a> like bags and cutlery.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Previous efforts to reduce the use of plastic bags have faltered in China, but the government has indicated that, this time, it will be more serious and systematic in tackling the problem.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese generally generate less plastic waste per capita than Americans, but almost three-quarters of China’s ends up in poorly managed landfills, or out in the open.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7. A new view of President Trump at Davos.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump leaves tonight for the World Economic Forum in<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Switzerland, where he is likely to see <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/business/dealbook/donald-trump-davos.html" title="">an increasing sense of acceptance</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S.’s growing economy, stock market boom and trade deals speak loudly to C.E.O.s, our DealBook columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin writes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For this year’s forum as a whole, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/business/energy-environment/davos-climate-change.html" title="">climate change</a> is at the top of the priorities. Several groups will be pushing companies toward greater disclosure and action on emissions. The question for many is: Will all the talk matter?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">8. A virus in China </strong>grows more threatening.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A top Chinese government-appointed expert says <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/world/asia/coronavirus-china-symptoms.html" title="">a new respiratory virus</a> is now being transmitted human to human, heightening fears of a possible pandemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization said it was convening an emergency meeting on Wednesday to evaluate the risk of the newly identified coronavirus. The known death toll so far is three, but human transmission could vastly expand its range.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese authorities said cases had been detected for the first time in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, far from the original outbreak focused on a live-animal market in Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">9. “I think the sky’s the limit for her.”</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s the tennis star Venus Williams talking about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/sports/tennis/coco-gauff-venus-williams.html" title="">15-year-old Coco Gauff</a>, who beat Williams in first-round action at the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/sports/tennis/australian-open.html" title="">Australian Open</a> in Melbourne today.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Elsewhere in Australia, dozens of fires are still burning, some out of control, in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But some places were hit by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/world/australia/weather-hail-sydney-canberra.html" title="">hailstones as large as baseballs</a>, wind gusts topping 70 miles per hour and an inch of rain in just 30 minutes.

Most of the deaths have been there as well. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both the World Health Organization and the United States have declared public health emergencies, and both have offered China technical assistance and expertise to investigate and contain the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Much is still unknown about the virus, including two factors that are pivotal to predicting the global human toll: how easily the virus spreads from person to person, and how many of those infected develop severe disease that can lead to death. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In late January, W.H.O. officials said that about 20 percent of reported patients in China had developed severe illness, including respiratory failure and pneumonia, and that about 2 percent had died. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But many infected people may have developed only mild symptoms and not sought medical care. That would mean the overall fatality rate could be considerably lower than 2 percent. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts cannot yet say who is at greatest risk for developing severe or life-threatening disease, and what factors may be protective against the illness. Children <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/health/coronavirus-children.html" title="">seem much less likely to develop severe illnesses</a> than middle-aged and older men. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States is barring entry by most foreign nationals who have recently visited China. Americans returning from Wuhan and Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, are to be quarantined for two weeks. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federal health officials are urging Americans to avoid all travel to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a very serious public health situation, and the C.D.C. and federal government have and will continue to take aggressive action to protect the public,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are just a handful of cases in the United States, however, and for now the risk to Americans is low. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-5fa06c1b">What is a coronavirus?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronaviruses are named for the spikes, which resemble a crown or the sun’s corona, that protrude from their surfaces. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. The infections can range from the common cold to dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html" title="">which sickened thousands of people around the world</a> — and killed nearly 800 — during an outbreak in 2003. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-332e2fc9">How dangerous is it?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus, and some scientists said initially that the new virus appeared to be less severe than SARS or MERS. </p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But recent news reports indicate that the Chinese authorities muzzled doctors who were first to recognize the new infection, and they may not <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/china-coronavirus-censorship.html" title="">have been fully transparent about the number of infections and deaths</a> even after the alarm was raised. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is also not clear whether cases and deaths in China are being carefully tracked and reported. Diagnostic kits and other health resources <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html" title="">have been in short supply in the affected regions</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists don’t know who is most susceptible to the new coronavirus. Does it pose a risk to young healthy people? Or, like seasonal flu, is it primarily a threat to the frail and elderly, and those with underlying health problems?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Whenever a new virus comes out, it takes a while to learn about it,” said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Right now, she said, “The information about coronavirus is changing rapidly.” </p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-4233383d">How is the new coronavirus transmitted?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most respiratory viruses are transmitted through coughing and sneezing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the Chinese authorities initially played down the likelihood of human-to-human transmission, it has now become clear there is significant and sustained transmission among people. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese scientists have warned that some infected people may transmit the virus to others even before they develop illness or experience any symptoms, although a published report documenting asymptomatic transmission in Germany has been criticized as flawed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If people with no symptoms at all or mild symptoms unrelated to respiratory illness — like headache or back ache — can transmit the virus, that’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” Dr. Schaffner said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A major concern is that with both SARS and MERS, a few patients inexplicably became “superspreaders” who infected huge numbers of people. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health care workers are particularly vulnerable. At a hospital in Seoul in 2015, one man with MERS transmitted it to 82 patients. </p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-525ab252">Where did the new coronavirus outbreak start?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Jan. 8, The New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html" title="">identified a new coronavirus</a> as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The cases were linked to a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. The market was later shut down and disinfected. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including SARS, also are believed to have emerged from live animal markets. The coronavirus that causes MERS is transmitted to humans by camels.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The animal that was the source of the new coronavirus is still not known, and the destruction of the Wuhan meat market has made the question nearly impossible to investigate. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html" title="">Bats are considered a possible source</a>, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, including coronaviruses. But it is very possible the virus was transmitted from bats to an intermediate animal, and then to humans.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened more than 40,600 people in China and 24 other countries.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-5cda2f4b">What symptoms should I look out for?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Symptoms of this virus include fever, severe cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. The incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be anywhere from 10 days to two weeks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If you have a fever or cough and recently visited China, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider.

Infections surged from 200 to 440, and global financial markets were rattled by the possibility of a pandemic emanating from the world’s most populous country during the Lunar New Year — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">Asia’s heaviest travel season</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Already, cases of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html" title="">pneumonia-like virus </a>have been found in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea, and on Tuesday the first was confirmed in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/cdc-coronavirus.html" title="">the United States</a>. Airports in Atlanta and Chicago said they would screen passengers from Wuhan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/health/china-coronavirus-airport-screening.html" title="">joining airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco</a> and cities around the world in doing so. North Korea<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youngpioneertours.com/north-korea-temporarily-closes-border-until-further-notice-coronavirus-precaution/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> temporarily closed its borders to foreign tours</a>, the vast majority of them from China. The World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday over whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million where the outbreak began, the authorities have banned group tours out of the city and ordered vehicles checked for live animals. Nervous residents are buying up face masks and flooding hospitals to report fevers and coughs. Some schools are canceling classes and even Buddhist temples are turning away the faithful.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At home and abroad, the Chinese authorities are facing demands for greater transparency in their disclosures about the disease, as new cases emerge in other major Chinese cities. As of late Tuesday, there were 440 cases in 13 provinces in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak is testing China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and the party’s penchant for secrecy in moments of crisis, 17 years after Beijing drew widespread criticism for withholding information and acting slowly in handling the outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 800 people and infected more than 8,000 worldwide.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xi, who has sought to expand China’s global influence, seems eager to shake the shadow of SARS and show that Beijing can handle a public health crisis like a responsible world power. A top party committee on Tuesday said in stark terms that it would not tolerate any efforts to hide infections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame,” the committee said in a post on a popular social media site. The post was later deleted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, China’s health commission said it would respond with measures intended to manage outbreaks of the most virulent diseases, including mandatory reporting of cases. It <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s7916/202001/44a3b8245e8049d2837a4f27529cd386.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">classified the virus as a class B infectious disease</a> — a category that includes diseases such as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html" title="">SARS</a>.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the government,<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>wary of letting fear run rampant,<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>is also working meticulously to control the narrative about the virus by censoring news articles and social media posts. The police in Wuhan <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/legal/2020-01/01/c_1125412773.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">investigated eight citizens</a> this month for spreading what it described as rumors on the internet.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, even as the government works to isolate sick patients amid travel by millions of people making visits for the Lunar New Year holiday,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>there is concern that the party’s long-held reluctance to divulge damaging news could hinder the effort to contain the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For weeks, the government had largely treated the outbreak as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-death.html" title="">a problem isolated</a> to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html" title="">Wuhan</a>. It was only after the Hong Kong news media reported that cases of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html" title="">coronavirus</a> had been detected elsewhere that the government began acknowledging, early Monday, that the disease had spread to other cities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many wondered why the central government waited until Monday to allow a top health expert to speak publicly about the outbreak. The expert not only corroborated what the Hong Kong news media had already reported but confirmed vital new information: that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/world/asia/coronavirus-china-symptoms.html" title="">the virus spreads between people</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The response is not fast enough, it’s not strong enough,” said Shen Zhengjiang, 57, a teacher, as he looked for masks at a pharmacy in Wuhan on Tuesday. “The local officials are paying attention to this now only because Xi Jinping spoke up.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak presents Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, with one of the most serious public health crises of his tenure. It will be a significant test of his leadership at a time when China is seeking to strengthen trust in the party and to project confidence in Mr. Xi’s authoritarian approach.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Any missteps could undermine the party’s credibility in the eyes of the public, experts said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is the sort of thing that could absolutely gnaw at the confidence and legitimacy of the whole regime,” said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts said the challenge for Mr. Xi would be daunting, as the world looks to China to stop the virus before it spreads on a global scale.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University, said that it appeared Mr. Xi was seeking to show that the virus is under control and would not cause social unrest. But he said the government’s initial failure to detail the spread of the virus to mainland cities and to disclose that medical workers had been infected was worrying.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“So far this pattern of a lack of transparency and inaction has unfortunately not changed,” said Professor Huang, an expert on the SARS epidemic. “The politics continue to constrain the government to respond effectively.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government, which has been praised by the W.H.O. for its efforts so far, has said it took time to analyze the coronavirus, which experts believe appears to be mostly transmitted to humans by animals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The delay in reporting the spread of the disease was attributed to technological challenges, but also bureaucratic ones.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some hospitals lacked testing kits, according to remarks on Monday by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent scientist who is leading a government-appointed panel of experts helping control the outbreak. The process was also slowed down, he said, because local hospitals were required to submit cases to the central health commission in Beijing for review before going public.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For weeks, the authorities in Wuhan seemed to play down the threat posed by the virus. The health department said that it had been found only in people who visited a local market that sold live fish, birds and other animals, and that workers had disinfected and shut down the site.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Questions have emerged on Chinese social media about whether the Chinese government has been forthcoming. Many articles and posts, including some using the hashtag #WuhanSARS, were censored.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After his stepmother died of viral pneumonia last week, Kyle Hui, 32, an architect from Shanghai, turned to Weibo, a Twitterlike site, to report her case. Mr. Hui’s stepmother was never formally tested for the virus, and he was concerned that the Wuhan government was underreporting cases of the illness. But his post soon disappeared from the internet.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People accuse me of spreading rumors, but I’m just trying to tell my stepmother's story,” he said in an interview at a cafe in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was not until Monday that the government changed course, after news outlets in Hong Kong reported over the weekend that there were several potential cases of the illness in Shanghai and Shenzhen, a southern city. The central government dispatched Dr. Zhong, a renowned expert with a reputation for bluntness, to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Zhong revealed for the first time that the virus could spread from person to person — noting, for example, that one patient had infected 14 medical workers.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Dr. Zhong won wide praise from the Chinese public, and memes circulated online contrasting his urgent tone with the calm words of local officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The spread of the virus has upended the Lunar New Year holiday this week, when millions of Chinese return to their hometowns to celebrate. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, some residents have canceled plans to go out to lavish meals for the new year and say they are avoiding enclosed spaces like movie theaters. Some firms have instructed employees to stay home. Many people now wear masks throughout the day, as they make dinner, play cards or chat with friends.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some residents are packing up and leaving Wuhan, vowing to stay away until the virus is contained.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the Wuhan airport on Tuesday, Luo Jie, 62, a retiree, rushed to catch a flight to Beijing that she had booked that morning. She said she wanted to “escape” because the outbreak reminded her of the SARS crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I hope the government will report the epidemic honestly,” she said. “That’s how to set people’s minds at ease.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Austin Ramzy and Elaine Yu in Hong Kong contributed reporting.

Opening statements begin Wednesday. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-01-21" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Exactly how many people are watching C-Span’s coverage is not yet clear. But there has been movement: Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, agreed to allow the presentations of the House managers and the defense to unfold over three days rather than two. He also allowed the House’s evidence from its inquiry to be admitted into the Senate record.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And while debate was robust, senators had to<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/politics/senate-impeachment.html" title=""> give up their cellphones and remain silent</a> at their desks at virtually all times “on pain of imprisonment.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. And in Davos, Switzerland, </strong>Mr. Trump proclaimed “the American dream is back.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though Mr. Trump spoke <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/business/trump-davos.html?" title="">mostly about the economy</a>, the annual meeting of global business leaders opened with a focus on global warming — and the dynamic between Mr. Trump and Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old climate activist.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Mr. Trump said it was “not a time for pessimism,” Ms. Thunberg gave a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/climate/greta-thunberg-davos-transcript.html" title="">characteristically cutting speech</a> to those who had not taken action on climate change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our house is still on fire,” she said, referring to her address at the same conference a year earlier. “Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. The first U.S. case of the Wuhan coronavirus</strong> was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/cdc-coronavirus.html" title="">confirmed in Washington State</a>, meaning the virus has now spread to at least four countries beyond China. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-maps.html" title="">We mapped it.</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday to discuss <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html?" title="">whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency</a>, since it’s now moving from human to human. In one case, a patient appeared to have infected 14 medical workers. Above, travelers in Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At least six people have died and hundreds more are infected, and there are scientific reasons to fear a pandemic. Airports around the world are continuing to check passengers from Wuhan, where the virus began in a seafood and poultry market. North Korea temporarily closed borders to tours from China. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">Here’s what else we know.</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4. Quite a day for Bernie Sanders.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hillary Clinton <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.html?" title="">criticized her former primary rival</a> in a documentary, saying “nobody likes him” and declined to commit to supporting him if he is the nominee. She later stood by her comments in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement, Mr. Sanders said he was focusing on the impeachment trial.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Vermont senator, who has been trying to quell a feud with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/politics/bernie-sanders-apologizes-joe-biden.html" title="">apologized to Joe Biden</a> after a Sanders campaign surrogate wrote an opinion article accusing the former vice president of having “a big corruption problem.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. An architect of the “enhanced interrogation” program</strong> testified at a military court Guantánamo Bay, facing five men on whom the now-outlawed torture tactics were used.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">James E. Mitchell, a former contract psychologist for the C.I.A. who personally waterboarded the man accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks, was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/politics/guantanamo-bay-interrogation.html" title="">defiant</a> at the pretrial hearing, saying that he’d been the focus of “untrue and malicious” reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The defendants are arguing that the confessions they gave the F.B.I., after sometimes years of detention at black sites and torture, should be thrown out. Above, Dr. Mitchell in 2017.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6. The return of Boeing’s 737 Max</strong> has been delayed again.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company said it did not expect <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/business/boeing-737-max.html" title="">regulators to approve the jet to fly until June or July</a>. American Airlines, United and Southwest had already taken the Max off their schedules until June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Boeing shares dropped sharply before trading was temporarily halted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yesterday, a Times report detailed a study critical of Boeing after a deadly 2009 accident that was never published. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/business/boeing-737-crashes.html" title="">Today, Dutch safety authorities made it public</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7.</strong> <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Women</strong> <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">have been doing better</strong> in the labor market, but the numbers conceal a problem: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/upshot/womens-gains-in-the-work-force-conceal-a-problem.html" title="">Their jobs still don’t pay well, and still don’t appeal to men</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The latest jobs report shows that male-dominated occupations (like those in manufacturing) tend be shrinking while those that are growing (like health care and education) are female-dominated. That, our Upshot reporter writes, puts men at a disadvantage and also keeps female-dominated jobs devalued and underpaid.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">And what if women ruled the world? </strong>The artist Judy Chicago posed the question on one of her 21 embroidered banners for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/t-magazine/dior-judy-chicago.html?" title="">Christian Dior’s spring 2020 haute couture show in Paris</a>.

Derek Jeter</strong> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/sports/baseball/hall-of-fame-vote-derek-jeter.html" title="">was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. The longtime captain of the Yankees, above in 2014, fell just one vote short of becoming the second player to be unanimously elected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Six players on this year’s ballot were part of a remarkable 2001 playoff game between the Yankees and Oakland Athletics when Jeter saved a crucial run in a play baseball fans know simply as The Flip. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/sports/baseball/derek-jeter-alfonso-soriano-hall-of-fame.html" title="">We looked at his most memorable moment in an extraordinary career</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Larry Walker was also elected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Also happening tonight: </strong><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/sports/tennis/naomi-osaka-australian-open.html" title="">Naomi Osaka</a>, the reigning Australian Open champion, is a heavy favorite against Zheng Saisai in a second-round match.

Researchers have pinpointed</strong> Earth’s oldest extraterrestrial scar in Western Australia. The cause was a large asteroid strike <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/science/oldest-asteroid-impact-australia.html" title="">more than 2.2 billion years ago</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That time frame coincides with the end of one of the planet’s ice ages, and there’s a real possibility that the asteroid actually triggered the change. The impact could have liberated an enormous amount of water vapor — which is a greenhouse gas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">In other news from the cosmos, </strong>today’s Great Read is about an Armenian research station built decades ago to study cosmic rays. More than 100 scientists worked there in its heyday.

And finally,</strong> what do your eardrums want for dinner?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Our restaurant critic, Pete Wells, hears a lot from readers about noise levels in restaurants. Often they implore him to do something about it — apparently beyond the impression of acoustics he gives in every review.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, he’s taking a stance.

It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent days, governments around the world have introduced special screening measures at ports of entry, and the World Health Organization is weighing the declaration of an international emergency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese authorities said that the measures in Wuhan were needed to “effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the safety and health of the people.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They said they would later announce an end date for the restrictions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The news spread quickly. On Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media site, the hashtag #WuhanLockdown was the top trending topic, with more than 1.6 million views.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese users left comments on the government’s announcement expressing support for the lockdown and concern for the residents of the city. “Go Wuhan,” several posted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Others wondered how sick residents would get from their homes to hospitals without public transportation. Some who said they lived in Wuhan asked what would happen to them.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Who will think of the lives of those of us who are healthy in Wuhan? We are also afraid,” wrote one user, who described herself as a designer living in Wuhan. “Even before the city was closed, we protected ourselves and hid at home. Now we are lambs who will still be slaughtered, and we can only leave our fates to the heavens.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Extreme measures during outbreaks have been imposed elsewhere before. During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html" title="">Sierra Leone </a>ordered everyone in the nation to stay home for three days as the authorities went door-to-door checking for new cases, retrieving dead bodies and trying to stop the disease from spreading further. In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html" title="">Monrovia, the capital of Liberia</a>, a sprawling neighborhood with tens of thousands of people was put under strict quarantine by the government and guarded by police officers in riot gear, setting off violent clashes with penned-in residents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html" title="">2003 SARS outbreak</a>, anyone in China who displayed symptoms of the disease was hospitalized, and students were examined daily. In Singapore, people suspected of having SARS were confined to their homes and monitored with webcams and electronic bracelets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, medical experts were startled by the scale of the shutdown in Wuhan, which has more people than the entire country of Sierra Leone. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that a city the size of Wuhan has “tens of thousands of connections with the outside world that are coming and going all the time, bringing food and medicine.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">”The complexity and downside cost of that will be potentially very high,” Dr. Inglesby said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Roughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data analyzed by researchers at Northeastern University in Boston. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. The city is the hub of industry and commerce in central China, home to the region’s biggest airport and deep-water port and sometimes known as the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2017-11/25/content_34984016.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Chicago of China</a>. It is popular among tourists for its colonial architecture, spicy noodles and proximity to the Yangtze River.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the short term, the sudden restrictions could upend the travel plans of millions of Chinese citizens, who travel in huge numbers during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Friday. The government said it would close Wuhan’s airport and train stations to departures, and it urged residents not to leave the city — a major transportation hub — unless they had an urgent reason to do so.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Lunar New Year in China is typically the world’s largest annual migration of people, with hundreds of millions of travelers fanning out across the country and the world, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent on hotels, restaurants and shopping. Before the virus emerged, the Chinese government had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/10/c_138694239.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">estimated</a> that domestic travelers would make three billion trips over the holiday period, also known as the Spring Festival.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But with the new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html" title="">coronavirus</a>, the mass migration is also an epidemiologist’s nightmare.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, a senior Chinese health official delivered a stark warning: The tide of travel during the holiday would make it more difficult to contain the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition, “the possibility exists that the virus could mutate, and there are risks that the epidemic could spread further,” said the official, Li Bin, a deputy head of China’s health commission. Chinese officials had already classified the virus as a class B infectious disease, a category that includes SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before the transportation shutdown, the Wuhan government had also issued a ban on large public gatherings and performances at hotels and sightseeing destinations. They had announced that all locals were required to wear masks in public to help prevent the spread of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tour companies had promised penalty-free refunds for hotel bookings and air and train tickets to and from the city. Travel operators had suspended itineraries with stops there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside of Wuhan, many Chinese have also already canceled travel plans, forgoing vacations and what for some is their only chance to return home for family reunions during the year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“After we heard how bad the situation was on Monday, we held a family meeting and decided that it just wasn’t worth the risk,” said Yan Chaowei, 32, a Shanghai resident who was planning on taking a seven-hour bullet train to her family home in southeastern Jiangxi Province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It just wouldn’t be a relaxing trip, especially with a small child,” she added. “When we finally made the decision to stay home, we sighed with relief.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Chinese companies, the outbreak could deal yet another blow at a time of slowing economic growth. According to official estimates, Chinese spent $74 billion on travel and $145 billion on shopping and food during the Spring Festival holiday last year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this week, the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, said that all travel by tour groups between Wuhan and Taiwan would be suspended. North Korea <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/coronavirus-china-north-korea-tourism-ban.html" title="">also temporarily banned foreign tourists</a>, many of whom come from China, according to a leading tour operator.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some international health experts, including the World Health Organization, have praised the Chinese government’s response as timely.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the government, particularly in Wuhan, has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">drawn public criticism</a> at home for what some see as a delay in the reporting of cases that evoked the memory of the SARS outbreak, in which the Chinese government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/23/world/sars-epidemic-health-politics-some-chinese-say-government-s-response-epidemic.html" title="">withheld critical information</a>. A top committee of the ruling Communist Party warned officials on Tuesday in a social media post that anyone who sought to hide infections would be “forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And new cases were continuing to emerge. In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday morning that the Mexican health authorities had identified a possible case in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The patient was “under observation,” the president said during a news conference. Gloria Molina, the health secretary for the state of Tamaulipas, said that the patient is a 57-year-old researcher in a university biotechnology laboratory who had visited Wuhan recently and works in Reynosa, a border town near McAllen, Texas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the spread of the virus, some experts are urging the public to remain calm.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a SARS-like event but not as severe as SARS,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/wang-linfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Wang Linfa</a>, director of the emerging infectious disease program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “During an outbreak like this from an unknown pathogen, overreacting might be better than underreacting, but we still have to be realistic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Zhu Niancheng, 19, a chemistry major at a university in Wuhan, appeared to be heeding that advice on Wednesday as he sat on a suitcase outside a Beijing train station smoking a cigarette.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Don’t worry, I’m not going to Wuhan,” he said, as a phalanx of People’s Liberation Army soldiers in green uniforms and black face masks marched behind him.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked if he was concerned about his classmates back in Wuhan, the teenager laughed and said, “I’m not really afraid.

The move was a significant escalation in the country’s attempts to contain the spread of the virus as the Lunar New Year approaches and holiday travel commences.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tedros and W.H.O. officials at the briefing said they had not advised China to close Wuhan, but nonetheless expressed support for the decision, saying it could protect other parts of China and other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Public health officials around the world are on alert because the new infection is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family that caused outbreaks of SARS and MERS, killing hundreds of people in dozens of countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The W.H.O. has already advised governments to be prepared for the disease, to be vigilant and ready to test anyone with symptoms like cough and fever who has traveled to affected regions. Air travel is expected to surge as the Lunar New Year approaches this weekend.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More important than an emergency declaration is the need for more data on the outbreak, said Jennifer B. Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists still do not have enough information about the severity of the disease, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I want to see from the emergency committee all the information on the table and an assessment of what the risk really is,” Dr. Nuzzo said. “To me, that’s far more important than their declaration.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One purpose of an emergency declaration is to draw world attention to an outbreak, so that governments can prepare and also provide needed help.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s already a high level of global attention,” Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that she was not sure how much a declaration would have changed things.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several countries have already begun screening travelers from China for fever and cough. Airports in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco last week started to screen arriving flights from Wuhan, and airports in Atlanta and Chicago will begin doing so this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Data shows that entry screening requires a tremendous amount of resources and is not tremendously effective,” Dr. Nuzzo said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">North Korea has suspended tourism because of the outbreak, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-northkorea/north-korea-to-suspend-foreign-tourism-over-coronavirus-fears-tour-company-idUSKBN1ZK1PK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to Reuters</a>.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Important questions about the outbreak are still unanswered, and W.H.O.’s expert committee now must grapple with significant unknowns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t know how many people are infected,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the W.H.O. “The more you test, the more you will find people who are infected. We don’t know if there are asymptomatic cases. If they are asymptomatic, are they contagious?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Broad studies to test for evidence of infection, past and present, would give a true picture of how many people have been exposed to the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus causes a pneumonialike illness, with coughing and fever in some people but not all. The severity matters: If there are cases with mild illness or no symptoms at all, they may go undetected, and those people will keep working, shopping and traveling, possibly infecting others.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A milder illness has the potential to spread farther and cause longer-lasting outbreaks than one with more obvious symptoms, according to Dr. Mark R. Denison, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who studies coronaviruses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Compared to SARS and MERS, the Wuhan illness so far does seem less severe, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS, which began in live-animal markets in China in 2002, quickly spread to dozens of countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800. The virus is thought to have originated in bats and spread to civet cats that were being sold for consumption.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The civets spread the virus to humans, who infected one another through respiratory secretions and also exposure to feces.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS often caused severe illness, so cases were detectable, Dr. Denison said; aggressive public health measures, including quarantines and travel restrictions, helped stamp out the epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the travel bans, not to mention widespread fear and distrust, took a heavy economic toll on China, and since then international authorities have become hesitant about taking drastic steps to quell outbreaks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">MERS cases have been occurring in the Middle East since 2012, mainly in people who have been exposed to camels, which were most likely infected by bats. Human-to-human transmission does occur, and some spread has happened in hospitals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As of November, there had been 2,494 cases of MERS in the last seven years, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The death rate is 34 percent, but may actually be lower if there are mild cases of the disease that have not been detected or counted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Denison described the new Wuhan coronavirus as “sort of a first cousin of SARS,” more closely related to it than to MERS, based on its genetic sequence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Researchers do not know just how contagious the Wuhan coronavirus is. The first people to be infected are thought to have contracted it at a market in Wuhan that sold meat, fish and live animals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That market has been shut down and disinfected. Which animal might have been carrying the virus is not yet known.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Initially, the illness appeared to spread only from animals to people. Then, experts said there was evidence of “limited” human-to-human transmission. Now, more cases are emerging among people with no known exposure to the animal markets, and in medical staff members caring for infected patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now that you have a cluster of 14 health care workers infected, it suggests that the potential for spread is much greater,” said Dr. Ian W. Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health in New York, who has researched SARS and MERS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I saw film footage of a hospital lobby in Wuhan, and they are wearing full personal protective equipment from head to toe,” he said. “They are taking it very seriously. I still don’t think this is as bad as SARS, but it’s worse than they originally portrayed it.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Denison said that with both SARS and MERS, there were episodes in which individual patients became “super-spreaders” who infected many other people, for unknown reasons.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s a wild card we don’t know, the capacity to have multiple transmissions from one person,” Dr. Denison said. “There was no evidence they had dramatically different virus.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is possible, he said, that super-spreaders had received a high dose of the virus and had more of it to transmit. Alternatively, their immune systems might have not been able to control the virus, allowing it to multiply and spread extensively in their bodies, making them more contagious.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although no drugs have been approved specifically to treat coronavirus diseases, Dr. Denison said that in animal studies, an antiviral called remdesivir appeared effective. He has been working with other researchers to develop treatments.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Jasarevic said that antivirals were being tested against MERS, but that none had been approved yet.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">How and why viruses that have peacefully coexisted with their animal hosts for a long time strike out for new territory — us — is not well understood.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronaviruses often inhabit bats without harming them, and sometimes move into other animal species and from them to humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In places that bring multiple animal species together with lots of people — like the food markets in Wuhan and in other parts of China that sell live mammals and birds, along with meat and fish — viruses can pass back and forth between species, mutating as they go. Along the way, they may become able to infect humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Coronaviruses have repeatedly shown an ability to probe across species and cause new animal and human diseases,” Dr. Denison said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To go successfully from animal hosts to people, the viruses need to adapt in several ways: They must gain the ability to invade human cells, evade the immune system, replicate inside the human body and spread to others.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The move is often described as “jumping” into humans, but that is an oversimplification, Dr. Denison said. “The process it has to go through is more like high hurdles with a thousand hurdles along the way,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the new outbreak does not greatly surprise him: “This was a matter of not if, but when.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The deadly disease rippled across the world 17 years ago, abetted by a Chinese government that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/weekinreview/china-discovers-secrecy-is-expensive.html" title="">covered up</a> its spread. As the scope of it became clear, China’s journalists, intellectuals and other critics helped shame Beijing into opening up about the problem.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“SARS has been our country’s 9/11,” said Xu Zhiyuan, then a young newspaper columnist and a fierce critic of the government’s handling of SARS, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/13/world/rude-awakening.html" title="">in a 2003 interview</a> with The New York Times. “It has forced us to pay attention to the real meaning of globalization.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, China faces the spread of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">another mysterious disease</a>, a coronavirus, which so far has killed 17 people and infected more than 570. And while Beijing’s response has improved in some ways, it has regressed in others. It is censoring criticism. It is detaining people for spreading what it calls “rumors.” It is suppressing information it deems alarming.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though China’s censors are busily scrubbing the Chinese internet, the country’s online community is registering its disappointment and alarm over Beijing’s handling of the new virus that has spread since December from the city of Wuhan to other countries, even <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/cdc-coronavirus.html" title="">the United States</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I thought SARS would force China to rethink its governance model,” Mr. Xu, now a video talk show host, wrote on social media on Tuesday, also posting a screenshot of his 2003 quote in The Times. “I was too naïve.”</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In many ways, China has changed for the better since the SARS epidemic. Its economy has grown eightfold. It has built more skyscrapers, subways and high-speed rail lines than any other country. Its tech companies rival Silicon Valley’s giants. A more responsive bureaucracy provides more people with health care, social services and even quality-of-life improvements like parks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When it comes to handling diseases, the public health system has greatly improved. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-maps.html" title="">Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak</a>, is also home to one of the most advanced epidemic disease research <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ShanghaiEye/status/1093160842638446592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">laboratories</a> in the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those improvements have come at a price. The government has tightened its grip on the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/internet-censorship-in-china" title="">internet</a>, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/world/asia/china-journalists-crackdown.html" title="">media</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/magazine/the-lonely-crusade-of-chinas-human-rights-lawyers.html" title="">civil society</a>. It has deeper pockets and a greater ability to control the flow of information across the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a result, many of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/07/international/asia/7-at-chinese-paper-held-after-articles-on-new-sars-case.html" title="">media outlets</a>, advocacy groups, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/world/china-releases-the-sars-whistle-blower.html" title="">activists</a> and others who held the government accountable in 2003 have been silenced or sidelined.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The system is successful in that it destroyed the people with integrity, the institutions with credibility and a society capable of narrating its own stories,” Mr. Xu said on social media. “What’s left is an arrogant power, a bunch of messy information and many fragile, isolated and angry individuals.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even as the new virus spread through Wuhan, the government took pains to keep up appearances.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first case was reported Dec. 8. As the disease spread, Wuhan officials insisted that it was controlled and treatable. The police questioned eight people who posted on social media about the virus, saying they had spread “rumors.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Saturday, two days before Wuhan told the world about the severity of the outbreak, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4462935805605012?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">it hosted a potluck banquet</a> attended by more than 40,000 families so the city could apply for a world record for most dishes served at an event. On the day it broke the news to the world, it also announced that it was distributing 200,000 free tickets to residents for festival activities during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins this Saturday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The central government backed Wuhan’s officials. Wang Guangfa, a prominent government respiratory expert, told the state broadcaster China Central Television on Jan. 10 that the Wuhan pneumonia was “under control” and mostly a “mild condition.” Eleven days later, he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.weibo.com/2656274875/IqCSrAXel?type=comment#_rnd1579700865617" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">confirmed</a> to Chinese media that he might have contracted the virus himself during an inspection in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Recognizing an outbreak can take time, and China is not the first government caught flat footed by a disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the choices made by government officials had an impact on a major commercial and transportation hub. Wuhan is a city of 11 million people, including nearly one million college students from across the country. By the time it disclosed the seriousness of the outbreak, the 40-day Lunar New Year travel season, when Chinese people take an estimated <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/10/c_138694239.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">three billion trips</a> combined, had already begun.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People might have made different decisions had websites and headlines described growing worries. Instead, they traveled. On Tuesday, all five confirmed cases in Beijing were people who had traveled to Wuhan in January for business, study or leisure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until a week ago, some people in China called it the “patriotic virus." Cases appeared in Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and elsewhere in Asia. No other Chinese city but Wuhan reported infection cases. It was not until the Hong Kong news media reported over the weekend that the virus had been found in other cities did officials elsewhere come forward.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some critics see parallels to SARS. In 2003, the Guangzhou newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily first reported the SARS outbreak. A military doctor, Jiang Yanyong, came forward with what he knew. Only then did officials act.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The way this virus came into the public view is the same as that of SARS 17 years ago,” said Rose Luqiu, an assistant journalism professor who covered SARS as a reporter for the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of those brave voices in 2003 are gone. Like almost all Chinese media outlets that were active in the 1990s and 2000s, the Southern Metropolis Daily has lost its freedom to pursue coverage that holds local governments, if not Beijing, accountable. Only a few mainland news media outlets are covering the current crisis critically, and then only with an analytical tone.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2003, Phoenix Television called Ms. Luqiu, then a star reporter, back from Iraq to report on SARS in Beijing. She shadowed the newly appointed Beijing mayor, Wang Qishan, for a week to cover how the government dealt with the crisis. Mr. Wang later became the vice president of China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That kind of openness is unimaginable now. Last week, when a group of Hong Kong journalists went to the Wuhan hospital that took in most coronavirus patients, the police <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://news.tvb.com/local/5e1d7dc434b0315b57158f6a/%E6%9C%AC%E6%B8%AF%E5%A4%9A%E5%90%8D%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E9%86%AB%E9%99%A2%E6%8E%A1%E8%A8%AA%E6%99%82%E8%A2%AB%E6%89%A3%E6%9F%A5-%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82%E5%88%AA%E9%99%A4%E6%8B%8D%E6%94%9D%E7%B4%A0%E6%9D%90" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">detained</a> them for a few hours. They were asked to delete their TV footage and hand in their phones and cameras for inspection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, Ms. Luqiu wrote an article for qq.com, the news site owned by the internet giant Tencent, about the measures the Hong Kong government has taken in dealing with the virus. The article was deleted 10 hours later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Jiang, the military doctor who became a whistle-blower in 2003, has been put under periodic house arrest and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/world/asia/13doctor.html" title="">forbidden</a> to visit the United States to collect a human rights award. He is also portrayed as a bad role model. A multiple-choice question posed by a test-prep school in 2017 asked about Dr. Jiang’s decision. The correct answer was B: It was wrong because it harmed the interests of the nation, the society and the community and should be subject to legal punishment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s disclosures have improved in many ways since SARS. The government admitted the problem faster. Beijing officials have shown determination to be more transparent. A top party committee said on Tuesday that it would not tolerate any efforts to hide infections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame,” the committee said in a post on WeChat. The post was later deleted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But when the government is the only source of information, wise advice and valuable clues can be lost. A police bureau in eastern Shandong Province posted on the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo on Wednesday that it had detained four residents who spread rumors that there was a suspected coronavirus patient in the district.

Hernández, a correspondent in our Beijing bureau, is </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">reporting this week from the Chinese city of Wuhan</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Mike Ives, on the Briefings team, spoke with Javier via Slack, a messaging service.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Hi, Javier. What’s the mood in Wuhan right now?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Walking the streets, you definitely feel a sense of urgency is spreading. Lots of people are now wearing masks and avoiding big crowds. All of this is happening in the midst of the Lunar New Year holiday, so it has forced many families to rethink their plans. People are canceling dinners, staying home from work and hunkering down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">It must be hard to avoid big crowds in a city of 11 million people.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, it’s almost impossible to avoid crowds in a modern Chinese city. But Wuhan is trying to push people to take more precautions. When you get in a cab now, there are reminders about opening the window and wearing a mask. Some of the famous street markets are now totally empty, surrounded by signs warning about the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Are you hearing any common sentiments in your interviews?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several people told me about their memories of the SARS crisis of 2003, which killed hundreds of people in China. They’re worried this could erupt into a full-blown epidemic. Of course, others say they’re not very concerned and have faith that China can beat this. One common theme is people say they want the Chinese government to speak honestly about the severity of the outbreak — something that didn’t happen during SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Are you taking any specific precautions, like wearing a mask?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, at the advice of experts, my colleague Elsie Chen and I are washing our hands regularly and avoiding meat markets and hospital wards. We are wearing masks all the time. It’s a bit odd having that kind of barrier when you’re interviewing people on the street. But we’ve found that it is quickly becoming the norm in Wuhan. There are even videos now circulating of people giving New Year’s toasts with their masks on!</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">That’s it for this briefing.

Democrats began making their case </strong>for convicting President Trump and removing him from office.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/impeachment-case-trump.html" title=""> first of their three days of presentations</a>, Representative Adam Schiff, the lead House prosecutor, quoted Alexander Hamilton repeatedly, and played video clips of current and former officials who testified before Congress last year, and a few of Mr. Trump himself.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lashing out from Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump branded Mr. Schiff a “corrupt politician.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today’s presentation will most likely go late into the night, as did Tuesday’s. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html?" title="">Here’s the latest</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is presiding, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/chief-justice-john-roberts.html" title="">our Supreme Court correspondent analyzed the tough spot he’s in</a>, trying to “return to his day job with his reputation and that of his court undiminished by accusations of bias.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. What do the American people think?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A team of our journalists talked to 81 people from nearly 30 states — Democrats, Republicans and independents of various occupations and ages — to find out how the impeachment trial is playing outside of the Beltway and newsrooms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Refreshingly, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/22/us/impeachment-voters.html" title="">not all the views we heard were partisan</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. Three of the top presidential candidates </strong>are pinned down in Washington for the impeachment trial: Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/sanders-biden-democratic-polls.html" title="">a new national poll</a> shows Mr. Sanders, above last week in New Hampshire, with a lead. A second national survey conducted by a different pollster shows Joe Biden in front.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In both polls, Elizabeth Warren finished third with 14 percent support. Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg traded fourth and fifth places. No other candidates had more than 5 percent in either.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Buttigieg has been camping out in Iowa, largely below the radar. And looking to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-iowa-caucus.html" title="">former President Barack Obama’s playbook</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4.</strong> <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">China said it was shutting down</strong> transportation from and within Wuhan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">the epicenter of a deadly new coronavirus outbreak</a>. Above, the Hankou Railway Station.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the W.H.O. has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/corona-virus-china.html" title="">postponed a decision</a> on whether the new outbreak is a global emergency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus has killed at least 17 people, infected hundreds and spread halfway around the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The shutdown in Wuhan could upend the travel plans of millions of Chinese citizens over the Lunar New Year holiday, officially beginning Friday. Experts have warned that the virus would proliferate during the mass travel period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. Two prominent U.N. rights experts</strong> said that Saudi Arabia’s crown prince <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/middleeast/bezos-phone-hacked.html" title="">hacked the cellphone of Jeff Bezos</a>, who owns Amazon and The Washington Post, to “influence, if not silence” The Post’s reporting on the Saudis. Above, the two in 2016.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They were drawing on a forensic analysis done on Mr. Bezos’s behalf that found with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/technology/bezos-phone-hacking.html" title="">“medium to high confidence”</a> that his device was hacked after he received a video in 2018 from Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s WhatsApp account. At the time, Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi writer who was later killed by a Saudi hit team in Istanbul, was a regular columnist.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Mr. Bezos received the video, the analysts said, his phone began sending large volumes of data. The relationship to a tabloid’s exposure of his extramarital affair is an open question.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Saudi Embassy denied that the government was involved in the hacking, calling the idea “absurd.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6. Tesla joined the $100 billion club.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/elon-musk-tesla-bonus.html" title="">The electric car company’s stock reached a record high — over $590</a> — resetting the company’s value beyond $100 billion. That was a signal of faith in electric cars and a humbling for automakers with longer histories and greater productivity.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The milestone also started a clock on a huge windfall for its founder, Elon Musk. If the valuation is sustained over at least six months, it could trigger a measure that allows him to buy some 1.69 million shares at about $350 each — a payout that could be worth nearly $400 million.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7. The Department of Transportation </strong>is proposing a regulation overhaul around service animals that would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/travel/service-animal-airplane.html" title="">ban all animals except dogs</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new rules would no longer force airlines to let animals like horses, above, accompany passengers who say they need them just for emotional support. An animal cannot just be brought aboard to make a passenger “feel better,” an official said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">And in other animal news, </strong>officials in South Florida this week issued an unusual weather advisory: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/frozen-iguanas-miami-weather.html" title="">iguana rain</a>. Overnight cold temperatures stunned the reptiles, which fell from trees, seemingly frozen or dead. Happily, they were reanimated after the sun rose.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">8. The singer and songwriter Yola </strong>describes her music as “genre-fluid” and “out of time.” That could have something to do with her formidable voice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her range stretches toward four octaves, “backed by the power to infuse whatever she sings with deep soul,” our music critic writes. Now she’s up for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/arts/music/yola-grammys.html" title="">multiple Grammy Awards</a> on Sunday, including best new artist.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dozens of categories include many musicians worth discovering. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/arts/music/new-grammy-artists.html" title="">Listen to our critics’ picks here</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The award show has been overshadowed by deep leadership issues. Deborah Dugan, the suspended chief of the Recording Academy, said she had been removed as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/arts/music/grammys-deborah-dugan-harassment.html" title="">retaliation for uncovering a range of misconduct</a> at the academy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">9. How do you reimagine “West Side Story” for 2020? </strong>By dismantling it and putting it back together again.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The three-year process of reimagining the 1957 musical masterpiece was intricate, physically demanding and sometimes maniacally ambitious.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From its opening moments, the new production urges you to to discard any expectations, writes the culture editor for The Times Magazine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/magazine/west-side-story.html" title="">She followed the cast and crew from rehearsal to Broadway</a>, where it opens Feb. 20.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">10.

Wuhan is a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/wuhan-coronavirus.html" title="">major port city of 11 million</a> in the province of Hubei, where all of the 17 previously reported deaths have taken place. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The victim died on Wednesday, but officials did not confirm that he had died of the coronavirus until Thursday, the Hebei provincial announcement said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement did not say when the man had returned to Hebei Province from Wuhan, but said that he had developed chest tightness and difficulty breathing after his return. Like many of the other confirmed victims of the virus, he appeared to have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/coronavirus-victims-wuhan.html" title="">other underlying health issues</a>: After being admitted to a hospital, he also was treated for high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the authorities said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-7bed71fa">World Health Organization decides not to declare a global health emergency — yet.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After two days of deliberations, an emergency committee convened by the World Health Organization <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/china-virus-who-emergency.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">decided not to declare a global health emergency</a> — but planned to meet again within 10 days, acknowledging the “urgency” of the situation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The committee had first planned to issue a recommendation on Wednesday about whether to declare an emergency (the decision ultimately falls to the W.H.O.’s director general). Such a declaration would give the W.H.O. broader authority to shape different countries’ responses. But committee members were split.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, after news of Wuhan’s travel restrictions and the increased death count emerged, the committee met again, and decided not to recommend the declaration.

It may yet become one.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only five global public health emergency declarations have been made in the past. The decisions are fraught, with health authorities wary of causing panic, or of suggesting that governments cannot handle outbreaks on their own.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the W.H.O. called on the Chinese government to share more information on how it was handling the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-6d4cdae6">The authorities suspend travel from more cities, affecting millions.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities expanded travel restrictions to several Chinese cities near Wuhan hours after announcing that the death toll and number of cases had risen sharply. Currently, at least 18 victims have been confirmed dead and more than 600 infected, according to Chinese officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The restrictions on train and other forms of travel will apply to tens of millions of people and come just days before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel around and out of the country. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it.

Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By evening, officials planned to also close off Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan, shut rail stations in the nearby city of Ezhou, which has about one million residents, and impose travel restrictions on the smaller cities of Chibi and Zhijiang.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Huanggang, public transportation and departing trains stopped at midnight. Residents are not allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. In Ezhou, all rail stations were to be closed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Separately, the provincial authorities in Hubei <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hubei.gov.cn/zhuanti/2020/gzxxgzbd/zxtb/202001/t20200123_2014602.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">announced</a> late Thursday some restrictions for the entire province, not just specific cities. Travel agencies are prohibited from taking customers and organizing tours, for example, and business trips are being suspended. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Schools throughout the province, which have breaks scheduled for the Lunar New Year holiday, will postpone their post-break start dates indefinitely. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has sickened people in Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Beijing, the government said it would cancel large public gatherings for the holiday, including fairs at temples that usually draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, and the Forbidden City, a popular tourist attraction in the heart of the capital, will close starting on Saturday. </p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-65cb2ea1">What is a coronavirus and how dangerous is it?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">Coronaviruses</a> are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Symptoms of infection include a high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. The incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be about two weeks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the headlines are alarming, health experts cautioned that it was too early to gauge the severity of the outbreak. There are too many unknowns: Where did it start? How easily does it spread? How does it compare to other coronaviruses, like SARS?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. William Schaffner, a specialist in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the illness should be viewed in perspective. While a new virus spreading internationally gets more attention, the much more common influenza virus is the bigger hazard for most people, he said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If I look at this winter respiratory season, influenza is going to cause many more illnesses and more deaths than this coronavirus,” he said. “It’s one of those circumstances where, if familiarity doesn’t breed contempt, it certainly breeds a certain nonchalance.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-9aad3f7">Where is the virus spreading?</h2>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As anxiety about the virus has grown, governments around the world have taken precautions to isolate anyone displaying symptoms, though several cases have proved not to be the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials in the United States said on Thursday that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/united-states-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">there could be a second infection</a> in the country, after the authorities in Washington State confirmed earlier this week that a man there had fallen sick with the Wuhan coronavirus. The second possible patient was in Brazos County, Texas, where officials said they were keeping a patient isolated at home while they did additional testing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Vietnam’s Ministry of Health <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/tin-noi-bat/-/asset_publisher/hwUjUacn23Hf/content/hai-ca-duong-tinh-ncov-ang-ieu-tri-tai-bv-cho-ray" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">announced</a> on Thursday that it had confirmed two cases of the coronavirus, in two male Chinese patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Mexico, two out of five potential coronavirus cases were officially ruled out by the Health Ministry on Thursday after comprehensive tests were conducted, according to state and federal government officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A health official said that one of the patients, a 57-year-old professor, had been diagnosed with a common cold.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The three other cases, in the western state of Jalisco, were under observation and were being tested, according to the Health Ministry report. The patients include a 42-year old man who returned to Mexico from Wuhan on Jan. 10, and two other women who had contact with him.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-14aa6667">Residents in Wuhan are nervous. Some are also angry.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Across Wuhan on Thursday, residents — some wearing masks, some sniffing or coughing — visited hospitals and clinics seeking treatment. In interviews with a New York Times correspondent in the city, some said they were angry about the sudden lockdown. Others said they were confused by the restrictions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside the Wuhan No. 3 Hospital, Yang Lin, said she had come to the hospital to see if a sniffling cold she had might be the coronavirus. After a quick check, the doctors told her not to worry. But she was not reassured.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They said it was just a common cold, and told me to get some medicine and go home,” Ms. Yang, 28, said. “But how am I to know? They didn’t even take my temperature. It’s just not responsible.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak is testing Wuhan’s health care system. Several Wuhan residents said on social media websites that they had gone from hospital to hospital, waiting in lines for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment later if symptoms persisted in a few days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Doctors told some patients that there was a shortage of hospital beds as well as testing kits, according to posts on Chinese social media sites. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s Ministry of Finance said on Thursday that it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://m.mof.gov.cn/czxw/202001/t20200123_3463972.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">allocate 1 billion yuan</a>, or about $144 million, to officials in Hubei to fight the virus, though it did not specify how the money would be used.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan officials also said that they would construct a new hospital specifically for coronavirus patients. The new hospital was ordered built within six days, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/1220420937818025989" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to People’s Daily</a>, the ruling Communist Party’s main newspaper.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cheng Shidong, a doctor at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, said in an interview that his hospital had set up 100 beds to receive infected patients, but that it didn’t have enough protective material, such as masks and suits, for the medical staff. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, Ms. Yang said that while she was in a pharmacy buying medicine, another person complained that he thought he had the coronavirus but had not been isolated. The city’s medical system, especially its smaller hospitals, seems unprepared for the influx of patients, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,” she said. “You shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’s unfair.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-d626f9">Who are the victims?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, released on Thursday its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/202001/5d19a4f6d3154b9fae328918ed2e3c8a.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">most detailed list of the people who have died of the disease</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first 17 people were largely older men, many with underlying health problems. All died in Hubei Province, which includes the city of Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first confirmed death was a 61-year-old man who went to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, weak with a fever and a cough. He was transferred to another hospital as his condition worsened, and he was later attached to a machine that helped oxygenate his blood. But he died on Jan. 9.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twelve of the other 17 deaths in Hubei were also men, and four were women, officials said. The youngest victim was a 48-year-old woman who died on Monday. The oldest were two 89-year-old men.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Separately on Thursday, the health authorities in Hebei Province, to the north of Hubei Province, announced that an 80-year-old man there had died, bringing the death count to 18.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of the victims had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three had no fever when they were admitted, according to the health commission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While a full picture of the virus is still unknown, medical experts found positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-22895c1e">‘I feel extremely powerless,’ says a SARS expert, raising an alarm.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In an unusually blunt interview, Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases in Hong Kong and expert on SARS, criticized the authorities in Wuhan for acting too slowly and obstructing his efforts to investigate the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Guan, who helped successfully identify the coronavirus that caused SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak in China, told the influential Chinese magazine Caixin that he was deeply frustrated by the city government’s response to the spread of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He and his team had visited Wuhan on Tuesday hoping that they could track the animal that was the source of the coronavirus but were shocked to find that residents at a market were not taking any precautions or wearing masks. No special measures were in place at the airport to disinfect surfaces and floors, either. This showed that the city government was being complacent despite the urgent orders handed down by Beijing, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I thought at the time, we had to be in a ‘state of war’, but how come the alarm has not been raised?” he told Caixin. “Poor citizens, they were still preparing to ring in the New Year in peace and had no sense about the epidemic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He also criticized the local authorities for disinfecting the market where many infections had been traced to, saying that made it difficult for researchers to investigate where the virus came from.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-31fcbb46">Some residents worry the government is underreporting cases.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are growing concerns that the Chinese authorities are underreporting the number of people who are ill with the virus. Relatives of patients say that some hospitals, strapped for resources as they deal with an influx of patients, are turning sick people away or refusing to test them for the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many people remain skeptical of the government’s official statistics, with memories of the effort to cover up the severity of the SARS outbreak still fresh.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, Kyle Hui, an architect from Shanghai, said that doctors at Tongji Hospital declined to test his stepmother for the virus, even though she was showing symptoms like a cough and a fever. She died on Jan. 15 of “severe pneumonia,” according to a copy of her death certificate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Hui said that hospital workers treated his stepmother as if she had the coronavirus, wearing hazmat suits. After she died, the hospital instructed the family to cremate the body immediately. Mr. Hui said that after her death, doctors informed the family that they suspected his stepmother had the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m very sad my stepmother left without any dignity,” Mr. Hui said during an interview this week in a cafe in Wuhan. “There was no time to say goodbye.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-67403245">A New York Times reporter travels to the epidemic’s ground zero.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chris Buckley, our chief China correspondent, headed to Wuhan from Beijing to cover the outbreak.

The train was a hubbub of conversation, much of it about the deadly coronavirus and the lockdown around Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Guo Jing, a worker from northeast China, was headed with two friends for a holiday in Macau. After some hesitation, they had taken off their masks. “They’re too uncomfortable inside,” Mr. Guo said. “My view is we have to be careful but not panic. If you’re the panicky type, then you wouldn’t be on this train.”</p>, <p class="css-tmn385 e6idgb70">1:37 p.m. — Aboard the G79 high speed train</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Half an hour out from Wuhan, the train is quite crowded with passengers. When I explain that I’m getting off at Wuhan, the reactions vary from advice — wear masks, don’t go, drink lots of water — to mordant jokes that I may be there a long time.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You should know that they probably won’t let people out until the New Year holiday is over,” said one woman, who would only give her family name, Yang. </p>, <p class="css-tmn385 e6idgb70">2:29 p.m. — Wuhan</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan Railway Station, usually thronging with people in the days before the Lunar New Year holiday, is very empty.

Scientists spar over possible causes.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists have been scrambling to understand the source of the coronavirus, in particular, the animals from which the virus may have jumped to humans. Many of the cases in Wuhan were connected to a market that sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. The market was closed and disinfected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early epidemiological research is indicating that it may have come from wild animals such as bamboo rats and badgers, said Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent Chinese scientist who was the country’s leading expert during the SARS outbreak, during an interview with state media on Monday. Named for its bamboo-heavy diet, the cat-sized <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siWvJ1Y4LP0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">bamboo rat</a> has become a somewhat popular delicacy in recent years in China, promoted for its purported health properties.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A group of Chinese researchers from the eastern city of Tianjin and Nanjing in the south, said the Wuhan coronavirus may have originated from Chinese horseshoe bats, according to a study they published in the Chinese Journal of Bioinformatics on Tuesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s National Genomics Data Center said the Wuhan virus was 88 percent genetically similar to a SARS-like coronavirus that was collected from bats in China in 2017.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still another group of Chinese scientists suggested that snakes were the “most probable wildlife animal reservoir” for the novel coronavirus, then transmitted to humans, in an article published in the Journal of Medical Virology Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But that assessment immediately drew fire from the international health community.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The study’s lead author, Wei Ji of the Peking University Health Science Center School of Basic Medical Sciences, did not actually find the new coronavirus in a snake, noted David Robertson, a professor at the University of Glasgow. Instead, Dr. Ji and his colleagues compared the genomes of an assortment of viruses and hosts and claimed to find a similarity between the genomes of the new virus and snakes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Ji did not respond to an email query by the time of publication.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-25a274b3">Many residents tried to leave the city.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement that the city of Wuhan would be temporarily sealed off from the outside world starting at 10 a.m. on Thursday came while most residents were asleep at 2 a.m.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some decided to flee the city.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents were seen hauling their luggage to a train station in the early hours before the citywide lockdown took effect, the Chinese news outlet Caixin reported.

Of more than 800 cases now reported, the wide majority — and all the 25 deaths — have been in China, according to Chinese officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“At this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said at a news conference in Geneva. “That doesn’t mean it won’t happen.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Make no mistake,” he added. “This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The committee weighing the decision was divided, its chairman, Dr. Didier Houssin, said during the briefing. Some members felt the course of the outbreak warranted an emergency declaration now, but others said it that was too soon to decide, citing the limited number of cases in countries outside China as well as the country’s efforts to contain the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Emergency declarations can appear to single out one country as a threat to the rest of the world. Dr. Houssin said the committee also considered the potential impact of its decision on people in China.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tedros said he would not hesitate to ask the W.H.O. to reconsider declaring an emergency, even within a matter of days, if more evidence emerges to prove that the outbreak poses a global threat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There will probably be more cases of the disease in other parts of China and other countries, and all countries should have measures in place to detect cases, including at health facilities, W.H.O. officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although several countries, including the United States, have begun screening air travelers arriving from Wuhan, Dr. Tedros said that the W.H.O. prefers exit screening for people leaving affected regions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is still a lot we don’t know,” Dr. Tedros said. “We don’t know the source, we don’t know how easily it spreads, we don’t understand its clinical features or severity.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new infection is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family that caused epidemics of SARS and MERS, which have killed hundreds of people in dozens of countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first cases of the Wuhan illness occurred in people who had been to a market that sold fish and a variety of live animals for consumption, and researchers think the virus came from one of those animals. But which animal is not known. The market was shut down, and it is not clear whether any of the animals or products there were kept for testing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finding the source is important, so sales of that animal and its meat can be halted. China has many such markets, and they were also the origin of SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, Dr. Tedros said, about a quarter of the people infected had become severely ill, but most others had milder symptoms. Most who died had underlying health problems, and many were older than 60.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 830 people have been infected with the virus in China, and at least 25 have died, according to Chinese authorities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Human-to-human transmission has occurred in China, but so far appears limited to people in close contact with patients: family members and health workers caring for the ill.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Carried by travelers, the virus has reached Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam and the United States. Investigators in other countries, including Mexico, are evaluating suspected cases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials in China have closed transportation links from and within Wuhan, and are imposing travel restrictions on other affected cities. These steps have significantly escalated the country’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus just days before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions travel in and out of the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tedros said that he hoped that the measures China took would be effective and short-lived.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only five global public health emergency declarations have been made in the past:</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">In 2009, for pandemic influenza;</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">In 2014, for a polio resurgence in several countries;</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Again in 2014, for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa;</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">In 2016, for the Zika virus epidemic;</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">And in 2019, for an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The decisions are fraught. Health authorities do not want to cry wolf by raising alarms about an illness that turns out not to be severe — or to ignore a real threat. If they act relatively early in an outbreak, as in this case, they may lack key information about the severity and contagiousness of the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are political and economic considerations as well. Declaring an emergency signals to governments that the situation is serious and that international help and cooperation are needed to contain the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Control measures may save not only lives, but money. The SARS epidemic, caused by a related coronavirus in 2002 and 2003, cost the global economy $30 billion to $100 billion, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759815?guestAccessKey=da12c4d9-bed5-4c36-88cf-4db717115947&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=012320" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an article published Thursday</a> in the medical journal JAMA.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But declaring an emergency may stigmatize the country struggling with an outbreak, and spur costly bans on travel and trade by other countries, even if health authorities discourage those actions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think there is a general sense that we need to go back and revisit public health emergencies and what they mean,” said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. “I think it’s not clear — do they or do they not bring more resources, or more controversy?”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Most of the best studies, which are randomized controlled trials, focused on how well surgical masks protect health care workers in hospitals from picking up infections from sick patients, and found that consistent use of them helped.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said surgical masks are really “the last line of defense.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We worry about people feeling they’re getting more protection from the mask than they really are,” she said. “Washing your hands and avoiding people who are ill is way more important than wearing a mask.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because surgical masks aren’t fitted or sealed, they leave gaps around the mouth, “so you’re not filtering all of the air that comes in,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The masks will, however, block most large respiratory droplets from other people’s sneezes and coughs from entering your mouth and nose, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Coronaviruses are primarily spread through droplets, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bigger problem is that people don’t use the masks properly. “Most people will put their hand underneath the mask to scratch their face or rub their nose,” bringing contaminants in contact with the nose and mouth, said Dr. Adalja. “You can’t take it off when you get a phone call.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious disease specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, said a study during an outbreak of the SARS coronavirus found that any type of protection — whether a mask or a respirator — reduced the risk of infections in health care workers by about 85 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The most important message was that the risk was lower if they consistently used any mask,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is general agreement that infected patients who wear surgical masks are less likely to spread infection to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed hospitals to ask any patients who have a fever or respiratory illness, have recently traveled to Wuhan, or have come in contact with someone who has traveled there, to wear a surgical mask. The C.D.C. also recommends that health care workers wear a respirator, which filters out more particles than a mask, when they are around such patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus in the United States — where there is only one confirmed case — is “way too low to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, who is co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/health/washing-hands.html" title="">washing hands — frequently and before eating — is universally recommended</a>. Hand sanitizer is effective against respiratory viruses. Experts also recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, rubbing the hands together and ensuring all parts of the hands — the palms as well as the back of the hands — are washed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s also important to keep your hands away from your face,” said Dr. Vaishampayan. “Respiratory viruses don’t infect through your skin, they infect through your mucous membranes: the eyes, nose and mouth.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The outbreak, which has sickened more than 540 people and left at least 17 dead, has triggered extensive protections around the globe, including extra screening and protocols for travelers coming from the Wuhan region in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the United States, passengers from Wuhan are being funneled to airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, where screening stations have been set up.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese authorities escalated their own actions, announcing plans to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">close off the city of Wuhan</a> by canceling planes and trains scheduled to leave the area of more than 11 million people. The World Health Organization has been considering whether to declare an international emergency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Washington State, officials declined to discuss additional details about the patient or the specifics of his travel, saying they would publicly disclose them only if they had trouble making contact with people who might be at risk.

The unit has a negative airflow to filter any air coming out of the room, and an adjacent room for workers to put on protective equipment if needed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Cook said the patient was doing well under treatment by a team of caregivers that volunteered to handle patients who have illnesses of particular concern or that may be highly contagious.

Dr. Lofy encouraged people to take typical steps that could prevent the spread of illnesses, such as washing hands and avoiding touching their eyes, nose and mouth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Currently, we believe the risk to the general public is low,” Dr. Lofy said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The strain of coronavirus surfaced in December and has spread through parts of Asia, sickening hundreds and killing at least 17 people. The authorities in China have since closed off Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending bus, subway and ferry service within it. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">Travel restrictions have been extended</a> to several cities nearby.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States has put travel limits of its own in place, funneling passengers who have traveled recently to Wuhan through a handful of airports, including Los Angeles International, that have special screening processes in place.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A passenger who arrived at Los Angeles International on an American Airlines flight from Mexico City on Wednesday night was taken to a hospital for a “precautionary medical evaluation,” officials said. Heath Montgomery, an airport spokesman, said he did not know whether the traveler had recently been to China or whether coronavirus was suspected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">State and county health officials declined to discuss the situation in detail, but said they did not have any confirmed cases of coronavirus. They have been providing healthy travelers arriving from Wuhan with information about symptoms and advising them to seek care if they become ill.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The union that represents more than 27,000 American Airlines flight attendants on Thursday called for airlines to institute immediate emergency measures, including procedures to manage potentially ill people. Lori Bassani, the national president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said airlines needed to do everything possible to contain the outbreak and minimize the chances of exposure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The health of our crew members and passengers is a top priority for us and we refuse to compromise their health or safety in any way,” Ms. Bassani said.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

It is home to a troubled and declining steel industry. It is a university town filled with college students.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The comparisons don’t go much further. Wuhan has a population of more than 11 million people, the equivalent of 36 Pittsburghs. In terms of college students alone, roughly one million are enrolled there, according to government figures. Summer temperatures can approach 100 degrees, with heavy humidity. Its traditional dish, and one of China’s favorite noshes, is a pungent pasta concoction called reganmian, or “hot dry noodles.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan is also the epicenter of a viral outbreak that is worrying the world. On Thursday, Chinese officials <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">sharply limited travel</a> to and from the city in an effort <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/corona-virus-china.html" title="">to contain a coronavirus</a> that so far has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds more. The restrictions hit the city at the peak of the travel period for the Lunar New Year holiday, meaning many residents may miss their families and loved ones this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan embodies China’s rise as a global economic power, in all its complexities. Disposable income per person soared more than sixfold between 2002 and 2018, according to government figures compiled by CEIC Data, an information provider.

It was Dec. 26, and Mr. Zeng, 61, was weak with a cough. He got worse. A day later he was transferred to intensive care, and on Dec. 30 he was put on a ventilator to try to keep him alive.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was moved to another hospital and attached to another machine that oxygenated his blood. Still, he got worse, and on Jan. 9 his heart stopped.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Zeng, whom the authorities have identified only by his surname, became the first confirmed death from the new coronavirus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan and has since spread around the country and beyond.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, on Thursday released details about the first 17 confirmed deaths from the disease. (Several more deaths were announced early Friday, bringing the death toll to 25.) </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The detailed information was released as the authorities <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">canceled transportation</a> within Wuhan and several nearby cities and largely blocked residents from leaving. Medical experts have questioned whether <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">the measures in Wuhan</a> have come too late to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has been found in infected travelers in Washington State, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong who visited Wuhan this week, warned that there was a potential for the virus to spread rapidly despite the controls put in place on Thursday morning.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have a chance to have a pandemic outbreak,” said Dr. Guan, who was part of the team that identified the coronavirus that caused the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Guan also told Caixin, an influential Chinese magazine known for investigative reports, that he had traveled to Wuhan hoping to help track the virus’s animal source and control the epidemic. But he left, he said, feeling “powerless, very angry.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised the Chinese government and the World Health Organization during the SARS outbreak, said that infected people outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The horse is already out of the barn,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An examination of the information provided by the government about the initial deaths show a disease that has thus far largely killed older men, many of who had underlying health problems.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three did not have fevers when they were admitted, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/202001/5d19a4f6d3154b9fae328918ed2e3c8a.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the health commission’s statement</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the first 17 victims were 13 men and four women. All were identified only by their last names. The youngest was a 48-year-old woman, Yin, who died on Monday, more than a month after her symptoms were first recorded. The oldest cases were two 89-year-old men who died on Saturday and Sunday. The median age was 75.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Most spent more than a week in hospitals, with some undergoing treatment for a month or longer. But two died just four days after they were admitted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While much about the virus remains unknown, medical experts found some positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a somewhat reassuring sign, Dr. Lipkin wrote, that “the majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese health commission said more than 570 cases had been confirmed in the country by the end of Wednesday, with 95 in grave condition. The outbreak has happened as China was preparing for the Lunar New Year holiday, the biggest travel period of the year, increasing the likelihood of the coronavirus circulating further beyond Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Guan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.caixin.com/2020-01-23/101507670.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in his interview with Caixin</a>, was critical of the local government, saying it had not done enough earlier this week to stop the coronavirus in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Even though the central authorities have said in the past two days they were attaching a high degree of importance, local health protections had not been upgraded at all,” he said. “At the time I thought this was going to be a ‘state of war.’ Why hadn’t the alarm been sounded?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Guan said he was disturbed by the lack of safety measures being put in place. At the airport he saw no disinfection being carried out and only a few random places like a Starbucks had put out liquid hand sanitizer dispensers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The situation was so surprising, “my jaw dropped,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said he continually ran into obstacles when trying to find researchers to work with on tracing the source of the virus. The seafood and poultry market believed to the source had been thoroughly cleaned, he complained, preventing any effective investigation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s no crime scene,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The path of the coronavirus could prove harder to trace and control than SARS, when a small number of highly infectious superspreaders helped transmit the disease to a large number of people, Dr. Guan said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ve experienced a lot, and I’ve never felt scared, most of these are controllable,” he said, citing previous battles with SARS, avian influenza and other outbreaks. “But this time I’m scared.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Javier Hernández contributed reporting from Beijing, and Amber Wang contributed research.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The extent of its severity has become more clear over the past two days, as Chinese officials reported a surge in cases and a jump in the number of deaths to at least 26.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, officials extended limits on movement in and out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to two nearby cities that millions more call home</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The uncertainty has put a palpable damper on Chinese life just before the Lunar New Year holiday — typically a time of travel, shopping and gift-giving — which begins on Friday. Train stations and airports were subdued as travelers changed plans for the weeklong holiday, and seven of the most anticipated film openings of the holiday season were postponed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Forbidden City in Beijing — China’s most popular tourist attraction — announced, without giving further information, that it would be closed starting on Saturday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the minds of many in China and around the world right now: Could this new virus cause the same kind of damage as the SARS epidemic, which killed 800 people in 2003?</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The question is a crucial one beyond China, because the Chinese economy has for years been one of the world’s most powerful growth engines. A stumble in China could hobble jobs and growth elsewhere.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s growth in 2003 plunged briefly during the height of SARS but came roaring back in a time when global companies were building Chinese factories and exporting more and more goods abroad.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, China’s economy is bigger but is growing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html" title="">at its slowest pace in nearly three decades</a>. It is grappling with problems like the trade war with the United States and a campaign to wean local governments and companies off their addiction to borrowing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It also depends more on consumers like Mo Chen, 29, who is curtailing her holiday travel plans, to stay on the safe side. In 2003, the worst-hit sectors were transportation, retail and restaurants.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Mo, who works for an internet company in Shanghai, had been looking forward to traveling home to see her family in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, nearly 200 miles from Wuhan. But given the outbreak, she and her brother, who lives in the city of Hangzhou, decided not to go home. It will be the first time that Ms. Mo has not spent Lunar New Year with her parents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She now plans to stock up on supplies and stay home, not even venturing out to meet friends or go to the movies. She also intends to skip a trip to the mall to buy new outfits, because nobody will be around to see her wear them. Her brother, meanwhile, is planning to buy pots and pans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He never cooks,” she said. “He always either eats out or eats at the company canteen. But last night our mom asked us to stock up on food, not go out and cook at home.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For now, the impact is not yet clear. The authorities seem to be responding faster to this outbreak than they did in 2003, but China’s censors are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/virus-corona.html" title="">erasing anything</a> that veers from the official narrative. The new coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, but it is difficult to detect, and the authorities started limiting movement out of Wuhan only after many people had set out for their holiday travels.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s going to depend on how China continues to be transparent with the international community,” said Peter Levesque, the managing director of Modern Terminals, a port operator in Hong Kong. “That’s all business can ask for. The rest is unknown.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan is essential to commerce in its region of China, though the economic impact there is expected to be muted by the advent of the holiday. The city is a major national transport hub and has become a center for auto manufacturing, with factories that build cars for General Motors, Honda and many others, as well as dozens of auto parts makers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the effect on people across the country could be a more important factor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the long term, China wants its consumers to spend more. Beijing has sought to develop a consumer culture similar to that of the United States so that China’s economy becomes less reliant on big construction and infrastructure projects that often receive government financing. But that shift makes China more vulnerable to events that spook shoppers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese consumer sentiment had already been bruised. Families spent the past year <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/business/china-consumers.html" title="">watching prices rise in grocery stores</a>, increases due largely to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/china-pork-prices.html" title="">the outbreak of a pig disease</a> that depleted much of China’s pork supply. More families are saving rather than spending, and are worrying about the future.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We will probably see a lot less domestic activity than we would normally see at this time of the year,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The concern is that it encourages people to cancel their travel plans, and it comes at a crucial time in terms of holiday travel and spending,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The disease has struck during one of the year’s busiest spending seasons. Box office sales during the Lunar New Year holiday last year set a record, reaching $860 million over the first six days of the holiday, according to Maoyan, a ticketing service owned by Alibaba.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New spending records will be harder to attain this year. Among the film debuts postponed on Thursday was “Boonie Bears: The Wild Life,” a cartoon about clever bears that clash with a hapless logger. In a message to fans on its social media account, the production company wrote, “We don’t want to see audience friends take any health risks,” adding that it did not want to “see that the epidemic may spread further.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other businesses in some parts of China have been temporarily closed. Major airlines, including Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, have restricted flights to Wuhan.

Officials said they would impose travel restrictions on at least four other nearby cities — Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang — affecting millions more residents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By limiting the movements of millions of people in an attempt to protect public health, China is engaging in a balancing act with a long and complicated history fraught with social, political and ethical concerns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, said the shutdown would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the United States.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It could very easily backfire,” he said, adding that the restrictions could prevent healthy people from fleeing the city, perhaps exposing them to greater risk of infection. “In general, this is risky business.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-38448c2">China’s expanding measures</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To combat the spread of the virus, which first appeared at the end of December and has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 600, the Chinese government said it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html" title="">cancel planes and trains leaving Wuhan</a> beginning Thursday, and suspend buses, subways and ferries within it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan, residents would not be allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. In Ezhou, which has about one million residents, all rail stations were to be closed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease dates at least to the 14th century, when ships arriving in Venice during the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days. The isolation period gave rise to the term quarantine, from the Italian quaranta giorni, meaning 40 days, according to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/historyquarantine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Professor Hodge said quarantines could be effective if they selectively isolate only those who have been infected or are suspected of infection. The response in Wuhan, with the establishment of a “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/science/using-a-tactic-unseen-in-a-century-countries-cordon-off-ebola-racked-areas.html" title="">cordon sanitaire</a>”-type boundary, goes much further than that.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Quarantine would be saying ‘You can’t leave your own home, can’t go to school, work or church,’” he said. But the Chinese authorities “have drawn a line around this city and said, ‘No one in and no one out.’ That type of thing is obviously an excessive response.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-6396ad5b">History and ‘the darker side of quarantine’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent years, governments have imposed other large-scale measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sierra Leone, a country of about seven million people, said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/world/africa/sierra-leone-to-impose-widespread-ebola-quarantine.html" title="">“everybody” was expected to stay indoors</a> for three days in September 2014, as 7,000 teams of health and community workers went door to door to find hidden Ebola patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier that year, Liberian officials placed West Point, a sprawling slum in Monrovia where 60,000 to 120,000 people were crammed into shacks, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html" title="">under an Ebola quarantine</a>. The order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to spread the disease, experts said, forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the SARS outbreak of 2003, Canadian health officials asked anyone in Ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/world/fearing-sars-ontario-urges-wider-quarantines.html" title="">stay home for a few days</a> out of fear that the disease might spread during the Easter holiday weekend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Beijing, at least 4,000 residents who had been exposed to the virus were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/international/asia/4000-quarantined-in-beijing-as-suspected-sars-cases-climb.html" title="">kept in isolation</a>, and 300 college students who had had contact with infected people were sequestered in a military camp for two weeks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Historians have noted that quarantines have often targeted marginalized populations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the plague epidemic of the 14th century, European city-states posted armed guards on roads and access points to keep out merchants, people with leprosy and minority groups such as Jews, according to Eugenia Tognotti, a researcher in Italy who has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559034/pdf/12-0312.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">written on the history of quarantine</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And during a wave of cholera outbreaks in Europe in the 1830s, Naples restricted the movement of prostitutes and beggars, who were thought to be carriers of the contagion, she wrote.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russian Jews brought typhus fever into the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1892, Dr. Markel said. It was not only infected people who were rounded up and quarantined on an island off the Bronx, however, but also their neighbors and others whom they had simply greeted on the street.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s the darker side of quarantine — its misuse as a social tool rather than its scientific use as a medical tool,” Dr. Markel said.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Mihir Zaveri contributed reporting.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Now look.”</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even as the Chinese authorities imposed the new restrictions — blocking expressways, cutting flights and warning residents to stay put — experts warned that the country risked a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in late 2002 and spread for months while officials played down its severity.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The updated death toll, announced early Friday by Chinese officials, jumped by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization’s emergency committee, meeting in Geneva on Thursday for the second consecutive day, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said</a> it was too early to declare an international health emergency though it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/china-virus-who-emergency.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">reconvene in 10 days or less</a> to reassess the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The images in Wuhan offered a jarring contrast to the attempts by Chinese leaders in Beijing to project confident composure. President Xi Jinping led a toast in an ornate hall in Beijing to the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday, and he did not mention the crisis in his remarks to the cheerful crowd of officials and guests.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even so, a sense of anxiety was deepening across China, with hospitals scrambling to cope with an influx of possibly infected patients and people lashing out online at the government. In Beijing, officials announced that they would temporarily close the Forbidden City.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday morning, the authorities imposed a travel lockdown in Wuhan, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/wuhan-coronavirus.html" title="">industrial city</a> at the epicenter of the outbreak.

Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang and Chibi, which are together home to more than nine million residents. And by Friday, restrictions had extended to Xiantao and Qianjiang, two other cities that include large rural populations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This was a very difficult choice,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan and the other locked-down cities, told <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2020-01-23/doc-iihnzhha4374343.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Chinese state television</a>. “Although Wuhan has taken a series of measures to ease things, there are certainly many hardships.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://news.cnhubei.com/content/2020-01/24/content_12643720.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">announcement Friday in the Hubei Daily</a>, the province’s official newspaper, indicated that the restrictions could vary from city to city. In Zhijiang, one of the cities listed, shops and businesses were ordered to close, except for supermarkets, food markets, and other ones essential for daily life.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some residents in Wuhan spoke speculatively of trying to skirt the blockade by driving on rural back roads to evade police checkpoints.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s serious, but not that serious,” said Wang Mengkai, a worker in an electronics parts factory who was stuck at the Wuhan Railway Station, hoping to figure out a way to join his family in Henan Province for the Lunar New Year celebrations. “If we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Anger and frustration spread among Wuhan residents lined up at hospitals seeking diagnosis and treatment for coughs and fevers. Most residents interviewed said they could see the logic of travel restrictions. But many accused officials of having failed to ensure that enough medical workers were properly trained, while medical workers reported shortfalls of critical protective gear such as masks and goggles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,” said Yang Lin, 28, who had come seeking treatment for what she described as a cold. “You shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’s unfair.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several residents said they had gone from hospital to hospital and lined up for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment if symptoms persisted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Doctors told some patients of insufficient hospital beds and testing kits. Some residents worry officials are underreporting the number of people ill with the virus, although the government has warned of dire consequences for those who hide or delay reporting cases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The government did not fulfill its duty,” Du Hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. “They just are doing things hastily and carelessly.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wuhan city government acknowledged that crowds were forming at hospitals, and it came under intensifying criticism from scientists and the public, who described the response as too little, too late.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts said that the mass travel restrictions, while understandable, would do little to stop the spread of the virus outside China, as many infected people had already left Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The horse is already out of the barn,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who had assisted the Chinese authorities in the response to SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In an unusually blunt rebuke, Dr. Guan Yi, a prominent Hong Kong scientist who also assisted in the SARS crisis, said officials had obstructed his efforts to investigate the outbreak during a trip to Wuhan this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said in an interview published Thursday by the influential magazine Caixin, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, in what experts described as a somewhat reassuring sign, the Chinese authorities released details about 18 of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/coronavirus-victims-wuhan.html" title="">people who had died</a> in the outbreak, showing that the disease has so far largely killed older men, many with underlying health problems. But the 18th victim was the first to have died hundreds of miles from the Wuhan epicenter, punctuating the risk of fatal cases far from where the virus was first reported.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts said the severity of the outbreak would depend on whether other epicenters develop, as happened during the SARS crisis. But they acknowledged that much remains unknown, including how easily the new virus spreads between people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan sits astride the mighty Yangtze River, and the restaurants and hotels along its banks — usually busy in the holiday season — were mostly shut. Retail streets were desolate, and the roads were often eerily empty.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But cars crowded around seven hospitals across Wuhan that have been designated as reception points for residents with high fevers that may have been caused by the new coronavirus. Some people waiting outside clinics in a drizzly rain said that their family members had lined up for much of the day to be checked by a doctor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After SARS broke out nearly 20 years ago, the Chinese government took steps to improve its public health system, including monitoring infectious diseases. But the lingering public distrust created by cover-ups of SARS and other health threats appears to have undercut those achievements.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://political-science.uchicago.edu/directory/dali-yang" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dali Yang</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said that while the current response has benefited from China’s improved technical capabilities since the SARS crisis, “what I find astounding was how the Wuhan authorities consistently downplayed the seriousness of the situation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lessons from SARS, he said in an email, were “that it’s important to let the public know and get the public to modify their behavior.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, China’s leaders maintained an unruffled face. The Communist Party’s most influential news outlets did not feature the crisis, choosing instead to promote Mr. Xi’s New Year speech and cheery reports about the holiday season.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, China Central Television, the state broadcaster, treated the situation in Wuhan as a footnote in its evening newscast, one of the most watched television programs in China, airing a roughly one-minute report on the outbreak. Experts said Mr. Xi appeared to be trying to prevent a sense of panic and to limit criticism of the party’s response.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The top priority will be to keep coverage from asking more probing questions about how China’s institutions have responded, questions that might lead to criticism of the government,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://chinamediaproject.org/2020/01/22/party-media-focus-away-from-outbreak/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David Bandurski</a>, co-director of the China Media Project, a group affiliated with the University of Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some internet users found ways around government censorship to criticize the response by local officials, saying on social media that they worried about a repeat of the SARS crisis. Many said they were also concerned about possible food shortages and higher prices on everyday goods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mao Shoulong, a professor of public administration at Renmin University in Beijing, said the Wuhan government had made a series of missteps that had eroded public confidence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They failed the test,” Professor Mao said. “They just copied the SARS situation, making small things turn into a big problem.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, and Javier C.

What’s the mood in Wuhan right now?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Walking the streets, you definitely feel a sense of urgency is spreading. Lots of people are now wearing masks and avoiding big crowds. All of this is happening in the midst of the Lunar New Year holiday, so it has forced many families to rethink their plans. People are canceling dinners, staying home from work and hunkering down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">It must be hard to avoid big crowds in a city of 11 million people.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, it’s almost impossible to avoid crowds in a modern Chinese city. But Wuhan is trying to push people to take more precautions. When you get in a cab now, there are reminders about opening the window and wearing a mask. Some of the famous street markets are now totally empty, surrounded by signs warning about the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Are you hearing any common sentiments in your interviews?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several people told me about their memories of the SARS crisis of 2003, which killed hundreds of people in China. They’re worried this could erupt into a full-blown epidemic. Of course, others say they’re not very concerned and have faith that China can beat this. One common theme is people say they want the Chinese government to speak honestly about the severity of the outbreak — something that didn’t happen during SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Are you taking any specific precautions, like wearing a mask?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, at the advice of experts, my colleague Elsie Chen and I are washing our hands regularly and avoiding meat markets and hospital wards. We are wearing masks all the time. It’s a bit odd having that kind of barrier when you’re interviewing people on the street. But we’ve found that it is quickly becoming the norm in Wuhan. There are even videos now circulating of people giving New Year’s toasts with their masks on!</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">That’s it for this briefing.

World events have a way of raising the stakes on a collection; what can a designer do to really merit any attention at all?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some, like Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren of Viktor &amp; Rolf, do it by engaging with the broader conversation: using small squares of lavishly toned fabric samples as haute patchwork on Laura Ingalls Wilder-worthy babydolls and ball gowns, often worn under enormous crushed metallic hats. Some, like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/style/fashion-bouchra-jarrar-couture-paris.html" title="">Bouchra Jarrar</a> and Julie de Libran, do it with intimacy: inviting guests into their homes to see how pared-down suiting and pretty little party dresses might matter in the actual world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And some, like Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, do it with dreams.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The master colorist of the couture and its anti-cynic, whose clothes often seem built on generosity of spirit, Mr. Piccioli was riffing on the subconscious backstage.

Narrowing his signature billowing silhouette, bringing it closer to the body in trumpet skirts and high-neck, long-sleeve embroidered columns, he played games with construction, so what looked like a gown with a peplum was actually three easy pieces — a long skirt hung from a light-as-air tank, plus a little vest atop that, plus a detachable ruffled belt — and what looked like a skirt and top was a single garment. Strips of satin at the hip of a three-tone bustier gown hid sweatshirt pockets, and tuxedos shifted over translucent panels.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What you thought you saw was not, in fact, what was actually there.

Until last Thursday, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011809064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">only 45 cases</a>, with two deaths, all in Wuhan, had been reported, and no <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arstechnica.com/SCIENCE/2020/01/WUHAN-OUTBREAK-TRIPLES-AS-NEW-CORONAVIRUS-FOUND-TO-SPREAD-HUMAN-TO-HUMAN/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">health care workers</a> were said to have been infected. The virus was mild, we were told then, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission; all confirmed cases seemed to originate from a food market where live animals are sold. On Jan. 11, local health authorities even suggested that the outbreak was over because they hadn’t registered any new case <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arstechnica.com/SCIENCE/2020/01/WUHAN-OUTBREAK-TRIPLES-AS-NEW-CORONAVIRUS-FOUND-TO-SPREAD-HUMAN-TO-HUMAN/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">since Jan. 3</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By Wednesday, though, 17 deaths and more than 470 cases had been confirmed. Cases of ill travelers from Wuhan have been reported in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the United States. Disease-modeling experts at Imperial College, in London, have estimated that as many as 4,000 to 9,700 people could be infected just in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to Guan Yi, a virologist based in Hong Kong, the trajectory of the Wuhan virus parallels the early spread of SARS, the virus that spread to 29 countries, sickened thousands and killed 774 people in 2002 and 2003. Perhaps just as worrisome: The government’s response today seems remarkably similar to its response back then.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government’s initial response to SARS was, at least at the national level, a combination of inaction, denial and deception. The earliest case of SARS occurred in mid-November 2002; it’s clear that by late January of 2003 the Health Ministry was aware of a dangerous new type of pneumonia in Guangdong Province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet the government did not issue a nationwide bulletin to hospitals with instructions for preventing the spread of the disease until April 3. And it was not until mid-April that it formally listed SARS as a disease to be closely monitored, with daily reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the wake of that debacle, the Chinese government does seem to have become more willing to share disease-related information with both its people and international health organizations. But the government continues its top-down, state-dominated approach in disease surveillance, reporting and response.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Global health experts have pointed out that this time around, the government was tight-lipped for two weeks after the onset of the Wuhan virus. Yes, it shared the virus’s genetic sequence, but only under increasing pressure from the international scientific community. For a time, the government tried to restrict the release of any information related to the disease. Local police departments threatened to punish anyone who spread “false information” about the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only two quasi-independent media outlets in China, Caijing and Caixin, provided extensive coverage on the disease, and there was little discussion of the virus on Chinese social media. According to Caixin, 15 health care workers were infected in Wuhan between Jan. 12 and Jan. 21. Yet the local health authorities — presumably in an attempt to play down the seriousness of the situation — chose not to report that fact until after Monday, after the government warned that any official who tried to cover up information about the virus, or delay reporting, would be “nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a result, people in China were poorly informed about the outbreak in its early days, when its spread might have been contained more easily. When I mentioned the Wuhan virus to some of my high school classmates in a WeChat group last week, one of them, who happens to live in Wuhan, was offended. “Our country’s disease prevention and control system has been very well developed and is transparent,” he responded. “Only overseas people are panicking for us.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That could be part of the problem: On Monday, 40,000 families in the city held potluck banquets to celebrate the coming Lunar New Year. The next day, municipal authorities were trying to lure more tourists to the city by distributing 200,000<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>coupons for free events. Needless to say, encouraging large groups of people to come together in the epicenter of a potential outbreak is not an effective health strategy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Along with its information semi-blackout, the government has failed to respond effectively. Yes, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention started an investigation immediately after the first cases of the mysterious pneumonia were identified. The Wuhan health authorities also conducted epidemiological investigations.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>On Jan. 1, they closed down the market where the first cases of infection were traced. And this week they halted travel to or from Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then again, back when SARS broke out, China’s health authorities also responded relatively well at the very beginning. The problems started when the government then failed to undertake effective measures to prevent the disease from spreading further.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both the Wuhan and the central health authorities could already have done much more to stem the spread of this new virus, including asking people to take precautions like wearing masks. Many suspected cases in Wuhan reportedly were not tested for the disease or quarantined; some people were simply sent home from the hospital without having been screened.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside Wuhan, even as the number of patients with pneumonialike symptoms has increased, the authorities may have been reluctant to report cases because the three-step confirmation procedure set out by the central government is so cumbersome. As a result, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3860486" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">no new cases</a> were reported in China beyond Wuhan between Dec. 12 and Monday, and yet cases were surfacing overseas. Some Chinese sarcastically took to calling the virus “patriotic” — a disease more interested in infecting people overseas than in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this virus is anything but patriotic. It is exploding in China and spreading to other countries, much as SARS did in 2003. Has the Chinese government fundamentally changed its response to a possible epidemic since then? It appears not, or at least not enough. And to my surprise, people in China, including some in the know, seem to agree. “From 2003 to 2020,” according to one article shared by a government adviser on a WeChat group, Beijing’s “conduct has not changed at all.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Yanzhong Huang is a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor at Seton Hall University’s School of Diplomacy and International Relations.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

What’s the mood in Wuhan right now?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Walking the streets, you definitely feel a sense of urgency is spreading. Lots of people are wearing masks and avoiding big crowds. All of this is happening in the midst of the Lunar New Year holiday, so it has forced many families to rethink their plans. People are canceling dinners, staying home from work and hunkering down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">It must be hard to avoid big crowds in a city of 11 million.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, it’s almost impossible to avoid crowds in a modern Chinese city. But Wuhan is trying to push people to take more precautions. When you get in a cab now, there are reminders about opening the window and wearing a mask. Some of the famous street markets are totally empty, surrounded by signs warning about the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Are you hearing any common sentiments in your interviews?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several people told me about their memories of the SARS crisis of 2003, which killed hundreds of people in China. They’re worried this could erupt into a full-blown epidemic. Of course, others say they’re not very concerned and have faith that China can beat this. One common theme is people say they want the Chinese government to speak honestly about the severity of the outbreak — something that didn’t happen during SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Are you taking any specific precautions, like wearing a mask?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, at the advice of experts, my colleague Elsie Chen and I are washing our hands regularly and avoiding meat markets and hospital wards. We are wearing masks all the time. It’s a bit odd having that kind of barrier when you’re interviewing people on the street. But we’ve found that it is quickly becoming the norm in Wuhan. There are even videos now circulating of people giving New Year’s toasts with their masks on!</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">That’s it for this briefing.

They are overcoming a lack of reporting in the official media by sharing their own videos and information — sometimes inaccurately. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some are even evading censors, who commonly stifle criticism of the government, to register complaints about how officials have handled the crisis.

The state-run media has largely played down the crisis, focusing instead on the encouragement of government officials and the heroism of medical workers.

She did not become ill until several days after arriving in Chicago, so officials do not think there is much risk to others who were on her flight home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She did not take public transportation, attend any large gatherings or have close contact with anyone outside her home after returning, officials said. Members of her household are being monitored.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman was taken to a hospital, but she is doing well and is being kept there primarily to keep the infection from spreading, officials said at a news briefing. They declined to name the woman or the hospital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first known case in the United States, of a man in Washington State who had traveled to Wuhan, was reported on Tuesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The immediate risk to the American public is low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing held by the C.D.C. More cases are expected in the United States, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sixty-three other people in 22 states are being monitored for possible infection, the C.D.C. said. They are people with respiratory symptoms who may have been exposed to the virus through their own travels or by contact with a patient. So far, 11 of the 63 have tested negative for the infection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The people being tested, called “patients under investigation,” were reported to the C.D.C. by state health officials. Samples from the patients — respiratory fluids and blood — have to be sent to the C.D.C., which tests them for genetic material from the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The testing takes four to six hours. The C.D.C. is developing kits that officials will send out to the states so that local authorities can do the testing themselves and get results faster.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know?

Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats of Illinois.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronaviruses are worrying because epidemics caused by other members of the viral family, SARS and MERS, have had high death rates: 10 percent for SARS, and about 35 percent for MERS. It is too soon to know the death rate for the new virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although influenza kills more people every year, its overall mortality rate is only about 0.1 percent. The number of the deaths is high because so many people become infected. The death rate of the Spanish flu in 1918 was about 2 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because of the higher death rates, widespread coronavirus epidemics could take a heavy toll, so the health authorities scramble to stamp them out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A major concern is that with both SARS and MERS, a few patients inexplicably became “superspreaders” who infected huge numbers of other people. At a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, in 2015, one man with MERS transmitted it to 82 patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The C.D.C. now recommends avoiding nonessential travel to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because the disease has spread beyond Wuhan, travelers to other parts of China should avoid contact with people who are sick, stay away from markets that sell live wild animals — believed to be the source of the virus — and wash their hands frequently.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federal health officials are asking people with possible exposure to the virus and who develop symptoms like shortness of breath, cough and fever to call health care providers first, rather than just showing up at a doctor’s office, clinic or emergency room.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With advance notice, doctors can take steps to prevent the spread of the virus, like isolating patients and putting masks on themselves and the patients. The woman in Chicago followed those instructions, officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is no antiviral drug to treat coronavirus infection, but a medicine called remdesivir has shown promise in animal studies and would be a good candidate for trials in humans, according to Dr. Mark R. Denison, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html" title="">There is also no vaccine to prevent the disease</a>, but researchers at the National Institutes of Health reported on Thursday that it might be possible to develop one ready for testing in people within a few months.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The incubation period of the disease — the time it takes for symptoms to develop after a person has been exposed to the virus — is thought to be about two weeks, Dr. Messonnier said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nearly 1,300 people are infected in China, and a handful of cases have turned up in at least seven other countries. All were travelers who brought home the infection from China. At least 41 people have died.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, the World Health Organization declined to declare the outbreak a global emergency, but it “may yet become one,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong>the W.H.O.’s director general.

Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This month, a shop owner in Hakone, a popular hot-springs resort town, posted a sign reading, “Chinese are not allowed to enter the store.” A photo of it was widely shared on social media in both Japan and China, and some began to wonder if the new coronavirus would amplify an anti-Chinese undercurrent that persists in Japan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Others applauded the shop owner’s move, saying that Chinese tourists often exhibited “bad manners,” a common theme in online complaints and news reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masanari Iida, a former candidate for public office in Kanagawa Prefecture, argued on Twitter that the owner was acting in “self-defense.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t understand why this is a problem,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/masanari_iida/status/1220578471669186560?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mr. Iida wrote</a>. “The store has a right to choose its customers.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fears have spiraled across Asia as China reported that the virus has caused at least 41 deaths and sickened nearly 1,300 people. The Chinese government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html?campaign_id=60&amp;instance_id=0&amp;segment_id=20602&amp;user_id=b6a9f6b7854f15308544c8d1a4d9b070&amp;regi_id=60810331" title="">has put a dozen cities</a> in the central part of the country on a travel lockdown, effectively corralling 35 million residents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Friday that Japan would increase efforts to quarantine visitors who showed symptoms of the coronavirus. The government also recommended that Japanese citizens refrain from visiting Wuhan for “unnecessary or nonurgent trips.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All Nippon Airways canceled all flights to and from Wuhan until Feb. 1. JalPak, a package tour operator owned by Japan Airlines, said that 50 customers had canceled trips to China in the past week because of news of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a cabinet meeting, Mr. Abe said he hoped that the public would not “worry excessively” and would act calmly, and he called for people to take the same precautions that they would for the common cold, including washing their hands and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/coronavirus-surgical-masks.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">wearing surgical masks</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With tourism from China such an important segment of the Japanese economy, some business owners said they did not want the coronavirus to affect views of customers from China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Seeing the news, we worry about the disease a little, but I cannot say ‘please don’t come,’” said Setsuko Yoshizawa, 70, the owner of a shop in the Tokyo district of Asakusa, the site of a temple that is often mobbed with Chinese tourists. “We cannot survive without customers visiting us. I welcome Chinese visitors.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japanese public sentiment about China has improved since the lows seen when the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/world/asia/dispute-over-islands-reflect-japanese-fear-of-chinas-rise.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">two countries were locked in an intense territorial dispute</a> over islands in the East China Sea, but it is still not terribly high.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to an annual survey by Japan’s central cabinet office, just over 5 percent of those polled in 2014 said they felt “an affinity with China.” Last year, the figure was about 23 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Komaki Lee, a Chinese-born naturalized Japanese citizen who has twice run unsuccessfully for public office, said he had often experienced discrimination because of his Chinese heritage.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When he was a candidate four years ago and again last year, he said, people defaced his campaign posters with the words “Go home!” or trolled him with similar sentiments online or in person.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now it’s the season for a lot of Chinese tourists to visit Japan, and there is this pandemic happening,” Mr. Lee said. “So I think that Japanese people will try to avoid Chinese people more, and I think that’s when discrimination might worsen.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the more hostile strains of anti-Chinese expression in Japan are met with pushback. When Tsuyoshi Iida tried to run for office in Kanagawa last year, his party declined to endorse him because its leaders said he had repeatedly posted hate speech online directed at Chinese and Koreans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This month, the University of Tokyo <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.iii.u-tokyo.ac.jp/news/2019112911060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fired an associate professor</a> of artificial intelligence, Shohei Ohsawa, who made anti-Chinese comments on Twitter, including saying that he would never hire Chinese students at a company for which he was doing research.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japanese attitudes about China may be shaped more by criticism of the Chinese government than its people, said Atsushi Kondo, a professor of immigration policy studies at Meijo University in Nagoya.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“More people question human rights and democracy over the Chinese government’s policy against the Uighurs or Hong Kong,” said Mr. Kondo, referring to the Chinese government’s detention of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html" title="">Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps</a> and its repression of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/hong-kong-protests" title="">the pro-democracy movement</a> in Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There might be some cases where some people experience trouble over the manners of tourists and have bad feelings,” Mr. Kondo added. “But I don’t think anti-Chinese sentiment is growing in general.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Eimi Yamamitsu, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Chinese were expected to travel home in time to help wrap dumplings or fry sticky rice cakes for all-important reunion dinners with their extended families. At midnight, families around the country usually set off firecrackers and fireworks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But these celebrations are set to be far more muted this year, particularly in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei Province where the authorities have imposed travel restrictions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, people waited anxiously on Friday outside Hankou Hospital, one of the medical facilities designated to test for the coronavirus, as their relatives sought treatment inside.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several said the Lunar New Year would pass without the usual celebrations or vacation travel.

Shanghai Huangpu River Cruise, the company that operates boat tours along Shanghai’s scenic Bund area, said the same. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shanghai’s movie theaters will be closed throughout the Lunar New Year holidays, a state media outlet said. Film companies said this week that they would pull new releases planned for the peak film-going period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A prolonged Shanghai Disneyland shutdown could add to the problems in the region for Disney, the American entertainment giant. Attendance at its Hong Kong Disneyland theme park has been battered by anti-Beijing protests that have swept through Hong Kong’s streets in recent months, frightening away many tourists from mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Disney <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/business/international/china-disney.html" title="">owns a 43 percent stake</a> in Shanghai Disney Resorts, while state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group holds a majority stake.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The closings at a peak spending time could come <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-china-economy.html" title="">at a considerable cost</a> to the Chinese economy, though it isn’t clear how big that toll might be.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Economist Intelligence Unit projects that the coronavirus could reduce China’s growth by 0.5 percent to 1 percent, compared with its projected growth rate of 5.9 percent before the outbreak, if the disease worsens on the level of SARS, the outbreak that killed hundreds in 2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That hit would be smaller than the blow from SARS. On the other hand, China’s growth is already slowing, unlike during the SARS outbreak, adding to Beijing’s problems.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-361ffbc5">Masks may help, but experts say it’s more important to wash your hands.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many infectious disease specialists say that cheap, disposable masks that cover the nose and mouth <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/coronavirus-surgical-masks.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">can help prevent the spread of infections</a> if they are worn properly and used consistently.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there isn’t much high-quality scientific evidence on their effectiveness outside health care settings, experts say.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said surgical masks are “the last line of defense.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The masks will, however, block most large respiratory droplets from other people’s sneezes and coughs from entering your mouth and nose, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Coronaviruses are primarily spread through droplets, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious disease specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, said a study during an outbreak of the SARS coronavirus found that any type of protection — whether a mask or a respirator — reduced the risk of infections in health care workers by about 85 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The most important message was that the risk was lower if they consistently used any mask,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But washing hands — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/health/washing-hands.html" title="">frequently and before eating</a> — is universally recommended. Hand sanitizer is effective against respiratory viruses.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-b95c66f">China’s propaganda arm features smiles and praises sacrifices as the disease spreads.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s propaganda machine has ramped into overdrive as the authorities fight the spread of the coronavirus, praising the sacrifices of responders and everyday people amid <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/virus-corona.html" title="">continued criticism online</a> of the government’s efforts to address the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mainstream Chinese news outlets have covered the outbreak closely, though censorship prohibits them from taking a critical look, while official news media like CCTV and The People’s Daily newspaper have played it down.

During the first half of the broadcast, six prominent CCTV anchors stood onstage and praised the instructions of Mr. Xi and the Communist Party.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They showed images of doctors and nurses treating patients, of trucks of supplies festooned with banners that said, roughly translated, “Go, Wuhan!”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They cited the example of Wang Qiang, the Chinese tennis player who earlier on Friday upset Serena Williams in the Australian Open. “As long as we’re not afraid and dare to confront challenges,” said<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Hai Xia, a longtime CCTV anchor, “we will win.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then they declared that the fight against the coronavirus was open, transparent and a testament to the competence of the government. Ms. Hai cited “the most transparent information disclosure, the strong leadership of the party’s Central Committee, the efforts of the whole nation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By featuring the response on the gala, the government gave its message a broad platform.

[<p>Advertisement</p>, <p>Supported by</p>, <h1 class="css-1qskr30 e1h9rw200" id="link-5dc904d3" itemprop="headline"><span>Is America Ready for Another Outbreak?</span></h1>, <p class="css-1ifw933 e1wiw3jv0" id="article-summary">No. But there are clear steps the government needs to take.</p>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">Saad B. Omer</span></p>, <p class="css-cpkn1d e1wtpvyy1">Dr. Omer is the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The last time the world heard about a coronavirus outbreak in China, in early 2003, it ended up spreading to more than two dozen countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia, sickening about 8,000 people and killing almost 800.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The illness was named severe acute respiratory syndrome, more commonly known as SARS and still remembered as a near miss. It could have been much worse, we were told — no thanks to severe mismanagement by health authorities in China and elsewhere.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The memory of SARS explains why reports of a newly identified coronavirus originating in China are concerning. The outbreak, originating in the city of Wuhan, has resulted in at least 25 deaths and rapidly spread to several countries, including, in one case, the United States. The World Health Organization has convened an emergency meeting and has been considering declaring the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Responses to emerging viral threats such as SARS and, later, Ebola have been controversial. During the SARS outbreak, many political leaders were caught unprepared. The mayor of Toronto, a city disproportionately affected by SARS, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lastmans-on-air-gaffes-add-to-torontos-woes/article1013974/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">publicly acknowledged</a> his unfamiliarity with basic infection control measures — he didn’t even know what the World Health Organization was.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2015, Donald Trump heavily criticized the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola crisis. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, urged <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/495379061972410369?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">maximalist measures</a>, such as not allowing Ebola-infected American aid workers back into the country. While there’s little chance that such an extreme step will be required this time, there’s also little evidence that Mr. Trump is taking the potential threat from the virus seriously enough.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fortunately, there are clear lessons to be applied from both the SARS and Ebola experiences.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, be ready for anything, and leave it to the experts. A measured, evidence-based response to this novel coronavirus would involve a series of rapid decisions requiring technical expertise. As the outbreak emerges, new — often contradictory — information will have to be incorporated into outbreak control measures. Fortunately, such expertise exists within the government.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The major public health and biomedical agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and its constituent institutes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, are led by well-respected scientists and public health professionals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The American response should be led by these agencies, rather than politicians. Decisions such as border screenings, travel restrictions and potential quarantine have major public health consequences, and they should be driven by science and emerging biological and epidemiological evidence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the Ebola outbreak, the C.D.C. took several useful measures, including providing guidance to domestic health care providers and sending Ebola response teams out to work with local health authorities in different parts of the country. The C.D.C.’s efforts were credited with preventing further spread of Ebola within the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, public health authorities should be candid with the public about the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds a new virus. At this point, we know very little about this new coronavirus, including its source, mortality rate and potential to spread. In order to avoid public panic, health authorities often end up providing false assurances in the face of genuine uncertainty. This “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://theconversation.com/listen-up-health-officials-heres-how-to-reduce-ebolanoia-33637" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">panic about panic</a>” can lead public health authorities to unduly play down the risks associated with an outbreak, which can undermine public trust.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead, public health officials should recognize that some level of concern is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.psandman.com/col/Ebola-2.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">within the range of normal and expected human responses</a> to emerging threats; they should clearly convey what is known, what is unknown and what is unknowable.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Third, the spread of rumors through social media during public health emergencies is, by now, a well-recognized concern. What is appreciated to a lesser extent is the push within the scientific community to rapidly share study results during emergencies by posting them online. Even for the current coronavirus outbreak, several analyses have been posted online by scientific teams around the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While this is a positive trend that can make critical information available in a timely manner, direct sharing of scientific results bypasses the peer review process essential for ensuring the quality of scientific evidence. Interim and sometimes half-baked results can be rapidly amplified through social media.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We know from experience that initial scientific insights often end up being incomplete and, in some cases, outright incorrect. One option for quality control of scientific output in a public health emergency is a rapid peer review entity — perhaps co-managed by major research institutes and funded by global health funding entities such as the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We need such rapid information and insight, but even more important, we need it to be right.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We are once again faced with the outbreak of an emerging pathogen with potentially global implications. We don’t know how bad it will get. But there is no excuse for not getting ready for the worst. We already know the consequences of inaction.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.saadomer.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Saad B.

The patient, a woman in her 60s in Chicago, had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier Friday, the Chinese authorities broadened a travel lockdown in central China to 12 cities near Wuhan. The orders effectively pen in 35 million residents to try to contain the virus, which had led to at least <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">41 deaths by Friday evening</a> and more than 1,000 infections worldwide.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Airline shares — exposed to the impact of travel restrictions related to the virus — dropped sharply, American Airlines by 4 percent and United Airlines by 3.5 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The news also battered shares of companies with significant exposure to the Chinese market.

Chevron fell more than 1 percent, while Exxon Mobil dropped 0.7 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Financial shares faltered after some regional banks reported lackluster demand for commercial lending in recent days. Huntington Bancshares fell 3.8 percent, while KeyCorp and Regions Financial both fell more than 2.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase fell 2.5 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The stumble in financial stocks mirrored a sharp drop in bond yields, which serve as the foundation for commercial lending rates and can have an impact on the profitability of loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.68 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Updates on the spreading virus overshadowed bright spots for investors throughout the day.

It came suddenly and unexpectedly. We should have been better prepared.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The emergence of the mysterious coronavirus could hardly come at a worse time for China, turning its biggest holiday into a time of deepening fear, restrictions and frustration.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The pneumonia-like illness linked to the virus has, by official count, stricken nearly 1,300 people in mainland China. At least 41 people have been killed, including 15 new deaths in Wuhan reported by officials on Saturday morning alone. More than 20 other cases have been confirmed elsewhere, including five in Hong Kong, two in the United States, three in France and, on Saturday, one in Australia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hundreds of millions of people in China travel during the holiday, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. For many migrant workers from the countryside, the Lunar New Year break is the only opportunity to spend extended time with their children. For growing numbers of Chinese people, it is a time for tourism to Beijing and other cities, or to foreign destinations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this year, desperate to contain the disease, the Chinese authorities have shut down transportation or imposed travel restrictions in 13 cities in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, hemming in 35 million people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The streets across Wuhan were eerily empty on Friday, except near hospitals. The city has been largely shut down: Departures are mostly barred, and subways, buses and ferries within Wuhan are suspended. Many residents lined up at hospitals to check for the illness or stayed indoors, rather than reuniting with family.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the entrance to the hospital where Ms. Chen waited, cars and bicycles arrived with frail older people to be checked. Residents said it had become nearly impossible to find taxis following the ban on public transportation. Doctors and medical workers struggled to cope with the surge of people worried that they had symptoms of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At another hospital taking in possible cases of infection, an old man sat in a wheelchair outside the building. It was too crowded and unhealthy inside, he said. Another patient shuffled across the street, holding a drip in his arm and its stand, so he could stay away from the crowd inside the hospital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We won’t have a New Year celebration tonight. There’s no mood for it,” said Wu Qiang, a middle-aged Wuhan resident waiting outside a hospital for word about his son, who had a fever. “I think he’s O.K., but now even an ordinary sneeze makes you worry. You start to think every cough or sneeze might be the virus.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many families in Wuhan, the Lunar New Year holiday now promises to be a week of anxious waiting — for medical resources and clarity about when they will be free of the virus and able to travel.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The government announced there were thousands of beds, but everywhere is crammed with people,” said Xiao Hongxia, a Wuhan resident who said that her father, Xiao Shibing, was not getting full care for what might be illness from the virus. At one hospital, she said, “the doctors were crying that they were helpless to do anything.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thirty of China’s 31 provinces and regions have confirmed cases, and two deaths have occurred far from the outbreak’s epicenter, one of them nearly 1,500 miles away. Cases have also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Nepal and Taiwan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials at Shanghai Disneyland, one of the biggest tourist attractions in China, and at the Badaling section of the Great Wall of China, a popular tourist destination north of Beijing, said they would temporarily close beginning Saturday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beijing canceled public events, including two popular temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital’s most famous tourist attraction, until further notice. Many cities shuttered movie theaters, bars and cafes in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Gauden Galea, the representative of the World Health Organization in Beijing, said in an interview on Friday that thousands of people would likely be infected, and that the outbreak could be long.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My own office is gearing up for a number of months,” Dr. Galea said. “We do not expect it to disappear in a number of days.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here in Wuhan, supermarkets seemed well stocked, but some residents said that prices had gone up or that fresh vegetables and fruit had become harder to buy because so many local markets had closed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More pressing are shortages of protective gowns, masks, gloves and other equipment to keep medical workers as safe as possible. Supplies have grown scarce in Wuhan under the weight of the epidemic, hospital employees in Wuhan said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside the No. 4 Hospital in Wuhan, two medical workers taking boxes of protective gowns from a truck said the gowns did not give maximum protection from the virus, but would have to do because better supplies were lacking. Some doctors and medical workers have bought their own maximum protection masks because hospitals were running short, one of them said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Shortage of medical supplies, request help!!!” the Wuhan Children’s Hospital said Thursday in a post on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.weibo.com/6449404416/IqQIGBlTT?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Weibo</a>, a Chinese social network.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wuhan government on Friday ordered that a new hospital be constructed in a matter of days to treat the victims.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The hospital, modeled on one constructed in Beijing for the SARS epidemic in 2003, will have room for 1,000 beds and is expected to be finished by Feb. 3, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.wh.gov.cn/2019_web/whyw/202001/t20200124_304126.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">local media repor</a>t posted to the Wuhan government’s website.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Galea, who visited Wuhan this week before the lockdown, defended how Chinese officials had handled the outbreak, saying they had been transparent in sharing data.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With the number of cases,” he said, “one would expect health systems to be stretched.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But online and in interviews, people around China have been unusually critical of their government, arguing that officials are reluctant to disclose bad news that might sully the Communist Party’s image of triumphant progress.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In posts on Chinese social media platforms, some users called for Wuhan leaders to be dismissed. Others mocked the failure of the Communist Party’s flagship media to treat the epidemic with front-page urgency. Most of those posts were quickly removed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a sign of how far the outbreak has scrambled the Communist Party’s messages, the annual Lunar New Year variety show on the main national broadcaster — which usually gives a cheerful face to the party’s themes — made nods to the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The show broadcast images of doctors and nurses treating patients, of trucks of supplies festooned with banners that said, roughly translated, “Go Wuhan!” The presenters declared that the fight against the coronavirus was open, transparent and a testament to the abilities of the Chinese government.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For Wuhan people, tonight the table should be filled with dishes of fish and meat,” said Ms. Chen. “But with my father sick, we’ll have a few simple dishes.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Reporting was contributed by Russell Goldman and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong; Ray Zhong from Shanghai; and Javier C.

She also cited interest rate cuts by 49 central banks and signs that industrial production around the world was starting to bottom out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Georgieva predicted that the global economy would grow 3.3 percent this year and 3.4 percent next year, but cautioned that “3.3 percent is not a fantastic growth — it is sluggish.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She warned that with interest rates already very low or even negative in many places, it would not be easy to respond if new difficulties emerged. In what appeared to be a veiled reference to possible <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-china-economy.html" title="">economic consequences from a new virus in China</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/business/australia-economy-wildfires.html" title="">bush fires in Australia</a>, Ms. Georgieva said that January had already produced events that posed new risks, and that policymakers would need to be able to respond more quickly than in the past when things went wrong.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin alluded indirectly to the new coronavirus that has led Beijing to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">quarantine more than a dozen cities</a> in China this week, saying that health challenges need to be watched closely. Problems at Boeing — which has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/business/boeing-737-max.html" title="">temporarily halted production of its 737 Max jets</a> after two crashes — could trim American economic growth by as much as one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point in the short term, he said, while adding that the United States still has a “very robust economic outlook through 2020.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Europe and Japan have been at the center of concerns that negative interest rates leave little room for policymakers to ease monetary policy and stimulate growth if needed. The top central bankers from both places acknowledged on Friday the dangers of negative interest rates even as they said they saw no immediate opportunity to tighten monetary policy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said she welcomed figures showing lower unemployment in Europe and wages rising at a rate of 2.5 percent a year. But she warned that inflation had not yet risen to the point that the central bank could tighten monetary policy — which would push up short-term interest rates and leave room to cut them later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are seeing inflation moving a teeny tiny bit,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said the Japanese economy was likely to keep growing at its recent pace of 1 to 1.5 percent a year. While that has been enough to keep unemployment very low, inflation is also so low — well below 1 percent — that the central bank “will continue accommodative monetary policy for some time,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who is also the finance minister, defended his country’s fiscal policies against recent international criticism that it was too tight. He said Germany has cut taxes and increased infrastructure spending, and planned large investments in its electricity grid and wind energy as it started to shift away from coal-fired electricity as a way to address climate change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a clear reference to this month’s Phase 1 trade agreement between the United States and China, Ms. Lagarde said the European Central Bank would be watching for whether recent pacts diverted trade from previous patterns. The Phase 1 agreement requires China to increase very sharply its purchases of American manufactured products, farm goods, energy and services, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/economy/china-us-trade-deal-allies.html" title="">raising worries particularly in Europe</a> that China will shift its orders away from them and toward American suppliers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The European Central Bank is looking at “who will lose out from that rediversion in various agreements,” Ms. Lagarde said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The only person from China on the stage was the moderator, Zhu Min, who is a former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China and a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He did not offer predictions about the Chinese economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In interviews on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, corporate executives tended to share the general optimism of policymakers while echoing their worries about the difficulty of cutting interest rates to stimulate growth if something goes wrong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The dangers of something has increased,” said Thomas Buberl, the chief executive of Paris-based AXA, which is one of the world’s largest insurers. “The instruments that we have to react to that are much more limited.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The Metropolitan Police said the technology will help “tackle serious crime.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a country with a history of terrorist attacks, CCTV cameras line the streets and police surveillance has traditionally been more accepted than in other Western countries.

But you never know with Williams: This loss could be “another setback on the path to a momentous comeback befitting her aura,” our tennis reporter writes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hours after Williams and the reigning Australian Open champion, Naomi Osaka, suffered stunning defeats (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/sports/tennis/coco-gauff-osaka-australian-open.html" title="">Osaka lost to the teen phenom Coco Gauff</a>), Roger Federer <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/sports/tennis/roger-federer-australian-open.html" title="">rallied in a gripping tiebreaker</a> to reach the fourth round.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">9.

A U.S. federal agency bans the sale of sheep lungs, a key ingredient for the distinctive Scottish dish. Haggis lovers have found ways around that.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For decades, a small but impassioned contingent of die-hard traditionalists has resorted to illicit methods to bring authentic haggis onto American soil — smuggling it through customs or crossing the border into Canada. One butcher in Toronto planned to send it in boxes labeled “clothing” or “gifts” to relatives in Florida.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Have a poetic weekend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/briefing/global-morning-briefing-newsletter-signup.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to get it by email in the Australian, Asian, European, African or American morning.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Want to catch up on past briefings? </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-evening-briefing" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">You can browse them here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">What did you like?

Residents responded with frustration on social media. One woman, who said she was pregnant and near her due date, asked if she was supposed to walk to her gynecologist’s office.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All the reported deaths from the outbreak have been in mainland China, but travelers have spread the virus to numerous other places. Cases have been confirmed in Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, France and the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities in Wuhan said they would also speed up the customs process for donated supplies, as hospitals in the city raise the alarm about a shortage of hospital gowns, surgical masks and other necessities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A notice posted Saturday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.customs.gov.cn/wuhan_customs/506378/506379/2851956/index.html?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">on the website</a> of the city’s customs agency said that new channels were being put in place to ensure that donations were put to immediate use. Overseas donations will be exempted from tax duties, the notice said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During past crises, the authorities in China have been criticized for their reluctance to accept overseas assistance, apparently preferring to project a sense of control. As China has grown more affluent, it has become <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/world/africa/china-pledges-60-billion-to-aid-africas-development.html" title="">a provider of aid</a> rather than a recipient, particularly to regions like Africa.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China has made exceptions during some past disasters, including <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/asia/16china.html" title="">a devastating earthquake</a> centered on Sichuan Province in 2008.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-354d41c">Schools in Hong Kong and the mainland postpone classes</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Saturday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, declared a health emergency in the semiautonomous Chinese city and said schools would be closed until mid-February.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two American universities with campuses in China also postponed their start dates. Duke Kunshan University, a partnership between Duke University in North Carolina and Wuhan University, said it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/news/special-message-novel-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">not resume classes until Feb. 17</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Classes had originally been scheduled to resume Feb. 3, after the Lunar New Year vacation. (Duke Kunshan University is not in Wuhan, but in Jiangsu Province, more than 400 miles away.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New York University also announced that its Shanghai campus would start its spring semester <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/january/2019-nCoV_Statement.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">one week later than planned</a>, at the request of municipal authorities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Schools in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is and where the outbreak has hit the hardest, had already decided to delay the start dates at all schools, from kindergarten through college.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-159b854d">Fifteen more deaths are reported, including one in Shanghai.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China on Sunday morning announced 15 more deaths from the new coronavirus, including one in Shanghai, the first to be reported so far in the metropolis. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thirteen more deaths were also announced in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, and one was announced in Henan Province. The latest deaths brought the toll in China to 56.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Across the country, 688 cases of the new virus were diagnosed on Saturday, the government said early Sunday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That brings the total number of confirmed cases to 1,975. Deaths from the coronavirus had previously been reported outside of Hubei, the outbreak’s epicenter. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the death in Shanghai, which is among China’s most populous cities and a major commercial hub, is likely to add to anxieties about the disease’s spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shanghai’s municipal health commission said on Sunday that the patient who died was an 88-year-old man.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Travel restrictions in Wuhan and 12 other cities have essentially penned in 35 million people on the country’s biggest holiday, normally a time for traveling to visit family.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-2aeec53b">Why is there so much panic?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the number of coronavirus cases and deaths is alarming, public health experts have so far warned against mass anxiety. After all, the common flu kills roughly 35,000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200,000 in the United States alone.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is too soon to know the mortality rate of the virus in the new outbreak. But there are signs that this outbreak could be far more serious than the common flu. For one, the virus has been identified as a coronavirus, named for the spikes that protrude from its membrane. Other coronaviruses have far higher mortality rates than the common flu, and have also led to global outbreaks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese citizens are also haunted by the memory of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, a coronavirus outbreak that also started in China and eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. During that epidemic, Beijing at first played down the crisis and withheld information, eventually drawing widespread criticism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And conclusive evidence about how the outbreak started is lacking. While officials in Wuhan first traced it to a seafood market, some patients who have fallen ill never visited the market. Researchers have also offered disparate explanations for what animals may have transmitted the virus to humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has promised far more transparency than in the SARS crisis, and the World Health Organization has praised its cooperation with the scientific community.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, mistrust of the local and national authorities is evident on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/china-social-media-coronavirus.html" title="">Chinese social media</a>. And China’s health system has already struggled under the new virus’s strain, with hospitals in Wuhan issuing urgent requests for help and donations.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-709121e2">Xi Jinping, China’s leader, says the nation will ‘beat the epidemic.’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a sign of how the spread of the coronavirus has deeply shaken China, the nation’s top leader, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/world/asia/xi-jinping-coronavirus.html" title="">Xi Jinping</a>, convened a meeting of the Communist Party leadership on Saturday to begin an offensive to stanch the spread of the outbreak, improve treatment of victims and speed supplies to areas under lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re sure to be able to win in this battle to beat the epidemic through prevention and control,” Mr. Xi said, according to an official summary delivered on Chinese television.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until now, Mr. Xi had said little publicly about the growing crisis, even as confirmed cases of infection with the new and little understood coronavirus multiplied over the past week and Wuhan — the city in central China where the virus first spread — and nearby areas came under a net of travel restrictions intended to contain the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xi issued brief orders about the emerging epidemic five days ago. Now, though, he has ordered mobilization across the country and drastic measures to hold back the virus, which is linked to pneumonia symptoms that can be deadly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The China television report showed Mr. Xi speaking to the six other members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s topmost decision-making body, and a circle of other grave-faced officials. The leadership meeting took place on the first full day of China’s weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, a time when the entire country, including party leaders, usually take time off for family get-togethers and relaxation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Confronted with the grave situation of this accelerating spread of pneumonia from infections with the novel coronavirus, we must step up the centralized and united leadership under the party central” leadership, Mr. Xi said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Communist Party will establish a top-level team, called a leadership small group, to grapple with the crisis, the meeting said, giving efforts to fight the outbreak greater urgency and centralized coordination. Here are some of the other measures and main points announced:</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Mr. Xi demanded strong efforts to provide medicine and other supplies, a point of anger among many doctors and medical workers in Wuhan who have complained about a shortage of protective masks, gowns and other safety equipment.</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Officials in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, received an implicit telling off. Residents and many other Chinese people have said that officials did not respond seriously enough. Hubei, the meeting said, “must make containment and control of the epidemic its topmost priority, adopting even stricter measures to prevent it expanding within and spreading outward.”</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">The meeting called for concentrating resources, experts and treatment to cope with the surge of infections, including sending patients with serious symptoms to designated medical units. This suggests that there may be more hospitals built or modified to deal solely with the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Local and military medical resources are to be pooled for the response.</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Public spaces across China, including railway stations, airports, and ports, were told to step up measures to deter the spread of the virus, including ventilation, disinfection, and body temperature checks for people. “When suspected cases are found they must be held for observation locally,” the meeting ordered.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-54d6963a">Beijing’s response highlights longstanding tensions between national and local officials.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Xi also seemed to address Chinese citizens’ growing dissatisfaction with the official response. On Chinese social media, users have asked whether the authorities have accurately reported the number of cases or taken enough steps to rein in their spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Commenters have especially condemned the perceived absence of the local, provincial and even national authorities in the heart of the outbreak. Mr. Xi had made few public remarks about the disease before Saturday, when he called for officials to “stand at the front line to safeguard social stability.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Where is that person? He is not on the front line,” one user wrote on Weibo, a Twitterlike platform, an apparent reference to Mr. Xi.

Two of them came into contact with an infected relative in a hospital there. Testing conducted days later, after they flew home, found that six members of the family had the coronavirus, including one who had not gone to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One infected family member, a child, had no symptoms, suggesting that people with the virus might be spreading it without knowing that they have it, the study found.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It shows this new coronavirus is able to transfer between person to person, in a hospital setting, a family home setting, and also in an intercity setting,” Yuen Kwok-yung, an author of the study, said in an interview. “This is exactly what makes this new disease difficult to control.” Dr. Yuen characterized the disease as “asymptomatic walking pneumonia.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The researchers cautioned that the study was limited to early cases of the virus, and that it was difficult to assess risk factors at this stage. But they stressed the importance of quarantining patients as early as possible, given the early signs of asymptomatic transmission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673620301835.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">study in The Lancet</a> found that symptoms of early coronavirus cases showed similarities to SARS.

Earthmovers, trucks and hundreds of construction workers dug and scraped to build a new facility that, if completed within days as scheduled, could do more than treat the ailing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government vowed on Friday that it would finish building the hospital in 10 days, a feat recalling the SARS epidemic of 2003, when Beijing built a hospital with similar speed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Besides treating infected people at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, the facility would also serve as a potent symbol of the government’s drive to do what needs to be done. If Beijing built a hospital in a few short days, in other words, Wuhan can do it too.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Saturday, officials announced that a second hospital was in the works to treat people infected by the virus. It would have a capacity for 1,300 beds. They plan to complete the facility, called Leishenshan Hospital, in 15 days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China is virtually unsurpassed in its capacity to finish in mere months the sort of factories, bridges and other projects that could take many years in other countries. The dozens of earthmovers gouging the soil on the outskirts of Wuhan attested to that strength.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But some workers at the site of the first planned hospital, called Huoshenshan, said there was a severe need for skilled workers. Many are at home or elsewhere, to keep from catching the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yuan Banfu, a worker from neighboring Henan Province, said a call had gone out on Chinese social media for volunteers to help at the site.

Nearly all the workers at the site, an expanse of brown mud in the drizzling rain, wore protective masks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m not too scared,” Mr. Yuan said. “I work outdoors and my heart and lungs are strong</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-4a39e862">A 2-year-old girl is infected, Chinese officials say.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials in a southern Chinese city said on Saturday that a 2-year-old girl suffering from the coronavirus had been admitted to a hospital and was in stable condition.

It was unclear whether he had showed signs of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The doctor, Jiang Jianjun, who specialized in infectious diseases, suffered the heart attack on Thursday while making rounds at the fever wards in Jiangsu Taizhou People’s Hospital, according to an online tribute posted on the hospital’s social media account.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He collapsed at his beloved workplace,” the statement read. It has since been deleted, but it said that Dr. Jiang had also treated patients during the outbreaks of the avian flu and swine flu.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">News of his death, along with that of a retired physician in Wuhan who was suspected of having the virus, drew much sympathy online, even as frustration brewed over the crowds at hospitals and the shortage of supplies. Several internet users questioned whether Dr. Jiang had died of fatigue.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As footage and photos appeared to show medical workers in white coats wailing from the stress of working several consecutive shifts, many social media users used forums to accuse the government of failing to provide adequate support to physicians working on the front lines of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many also blamed officials for failing to supply new protective gear and testing kits to hospitals facing shortages.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-42dd700f">Chinese-Americans are scrambling to help.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For people in the United States with close ties to China, the outbreak has brought unexpected worry, disappointment and scrutiny. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/wuhan-coronavirus-united-states-washington-texas.html" title="">Some in the Chinese-American community</a> have had their Lunar New Year holiday plans waylaid, as travel schedules for the coming week and beyond get interrupted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some are gearing up for the outbreak to get worse.

Cases have been confirmed in all but one of China’s provinces and autonomous regions, as well as in at least 11 other countries as the virus has spread to Europe, the United States Australia and, most recently, Canada.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the newest victims in China was a 62-year-old ear, nose and throat specialist, who died on Saturday, according to state news media.

Wuhan tightened its restrictions further on Saturday, with a ban on most vehicle traffic in the city center.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The restrictions began spreading far beyond Wuhan, too: In Beijing, the city government said it would halt all inter-province buses beginning on Sunday, effectively limiting road travel into the capital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The association of China’s travel agencies said that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for citizens headed overseas, starting on Monday. Groups already on their trips were allowed to continue, with the directive that travelers’ health be closely monitored.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The move to cut off group tours could have a ripple effect across countries that depend on Chinese tourists. While China is now home to an increasingly sophisticated population ready to hit the tourist routes by themselves, a large number of Chinese do not feel comfortable traveling abroad unless they are with a group.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New measures were also imposed in Hong Kong, where its leader, Carrie Lam, declared a health emergency.

But the coronavirus, like other health crises before it, is bringing out some of the deepest flaws and contradictions in a Chinese system that, for all its historic feats, remains a work in progress.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those flaws, which have long frustrated Chinese leaders, appear to have played a role in everything from the pace at which officials responded to the coronavirus outbreak, to China’s yearslong inability to address the health risks that experts have long warned could lead to an outbreak just like this one.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the country is now mobilizing a nationwide response — one of the system’s strengths — the incident is already a lesson in the political weak points that can bring grave consequences for China and, as infections spread, the world.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-5cde1a83">A System at Odds With Itself</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When you look at the coronavirus, it looks a lot like what happened with SARS. It involves a very similar template,” Mr. Yasuda said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in 2002 and 2003, initially spread unchecked when local Chinese officials minimized early reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their fear was not public unrest, it later emerged, but getting in trouble with the party bosses who controlled their careers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases in Hong Kong who helped identify SARS, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">has accused</a> Chinese authorities of once more delaying action, including by obstructing his own efforts to investigate the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a continuous theme in central-local relations in China. You do not want to be the one to bring bad news,” said Vivienne Shue, a prominent China scholar at Oxford University.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That gulf between central leaders in Beijing and local officials who run the country day-to-day, Ms. Shue said, is “the core conundrum in how that system works.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It leads officials on both sides of the center-local divide “to do many counterproductive, irrational things,” she said, in their efforts to manage and manipulate one another.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That has included holding back reports of potential crises, in the hopes of solving things without the bosses finding out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, China’s quasi-imperial system leaves the top party bosses in Beijing with little direct power over what happens in the provinces — policy proclamations are sometimes ignored or defied — other than promoting or punishing subordinates.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The two ends of the system are engaged in a constant push-pull dynamic, putting them occasionally at odds — particularly in moments of crisis, when each is looking to blame the other.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This has been an issue throughout China’s modern history, Ms. Shue said, with power fluctuating between the center and the periphery. Xi Jinping, China’s current leader, has sought to centralize power, setting up Beijing-based working groups to exert more control outside the capital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the system’s underlying contradiction remains. Mr. Xi’s tightening grip may make local leaders all the more wary of releasing information that could invite his wrath.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As China modernizes, integrating its once-disparate provinces and cities, local mistakes can become national crises before Beijing is even aware that something has happened, as may have happened with the coronavirus outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“As logistics and the distribution systems have expanded, you really see how the local and national have been linked together,” Mr. Yasuda said, referring to the hastening rate at which health, environmental and economic crises can now spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That is not all downside. The central government has enormous capacity to mobilize in a crisis, as it is doing now, locking down several major cities to slow the disease’s spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once a clear problem has emerged, it’s very good at diverting resources,” Mr. Yasuda said of China’s political system. “But it’s not good at dealing with emerging problems. So it’s built to be reactive instead of proactive.”</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-6a985ff9">When China’s Strengths Become a Source of Peril</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In some ways, China’s system has been a source of strength.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Party bosses set priorities, then reward the institutions and officials who best carry them out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And since the days of Mao Zedong, China has operated under a system known as fragmented authoritarianism, in which even the most local leaders have near-absolute authority over their remit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That has led to a culture of what Elizabeth J. Perry, a Harvard University scholar, has called “guerrilla governance,” in which results take precedence over procedure or accountability, and in which it is all leaders for themselves.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This approach is seen as crucial in having enabled China to lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty and turn itself from global backwater into world power.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it can be disastrous when it comes to managing health and environmental issues.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Disease and pollution don’t respect provincial or municipal borders. And because of the way they spread, it often takes a unified, nationwide policy to prevent or stop them — something for which guerrilla governance is ill-suited.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s very difficult to come together to create a clear actionable plan,” Mr. Yasuda said, adding that, for any health or environmental regulation to work, “you want it to be standardized, you want it to be transparent, you want it to be accountable.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But China’s system de-emphasizes those concerns, sometimes <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/world/asia/27milk.html" title="">to disastrous effect</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the mid-2000s, Beijing demanded a drastic increase in milk production. When factory farms were unable to meet their targets, officials conscripted vast numbers of rural farmers. Some of the farmers, struggling to meet their quotas, watered down their milk, then added an industrial chemical known as melamine to fool quality sensors. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/world/asia/27milk.html" title="">tainted milk poisoned thousands</a> of infants.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts fear a similar regulatory failure may have enabled the coronavirus outbreak: the longstanding inability to clean up so-called <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html" title="">wet markets</a>, which are stuffed with livestock living and dead, domesticated and wild. Though the outbreak’s cause is still being studied, Wuhan’s wet market is considered a prime suspect.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The markets have long been considered a major threat to public health, particularly as a vector for transmitting diseases from animals to humans. And they are a lesson in the perils of patchwork, decentralized regulations like China’s: While some markets are more carefully policed than others, all it takes is one to cause an outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In another echo of the tainted milk scandal, top-down political priorities provide an incentive to look the other way. Taking down the markets, which are popular, would risk a public outcry. Local officials had every reason to fear that their bosses, who have not made the markets a priority, would punish them for causing trouble.</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-6d023ea6">Aligning With Public Good, Or Not</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A foundational mission of any political system is to align its leaders’ incentives with the needs and desires of the wider public.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Democracies seek to do this through “the competition of interests,” Ms. Shue said, on the belief that inviting everyone to participate will naturally pull the system toward the common good. This system, like any, has flaws, for example by handing more power to those with more money.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within China, Ms. Shue added, the common good “is seen as something that should be designed from above, like a watch being engineered to run perfectly.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But sometimes the watch can be designed in ways that harm the public good.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2001, for instance, Beijing ordered provincial officials to reduce water pollution from factories. Many provinces simply <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069615000030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">moved the factories to their borders</a>, ensuring pollutants would flow into the next district. Nationwide, water pollution worsened.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, the coronavirus outbreak seems to highlight both the strengths and perils of China’s model. Beijing, apparently having learned from the SARS epidemic, has pushed for faster and more drastic action.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the same systemic problems, from gun-shy local officials to weak health regulations, appear to be recurring as well — a reminder that the system remains, Ms. Shue said, “a work in progress.”<br/></p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Hardware stores and pharmacies around the United States are selling out of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/health/coronavirus-surgical-masks.html" title="">masks that could help</a> prevent the spread of the disease. In the New York City neighborhood of Flushing, masks have been sold out for much of the week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese-Americans networking with their friends and family in China have scrambled to send aid. One woman in Los Angeles has amassed 20,000 masks to ship overseas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sean Shi, of Issaquah, Wash., said he shipped several boxes of masks to China in a friend’s luggage, with hopes that the masks could reach friends in the Wuhan area as soon as possible. Later in the day, Mr. Shi was back at a local hardware store, buying another 46 masks for some of his former peers at Wuhan University.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">How Is the U.S. Being Affected?</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb.10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We understand it’s a tough situation over there — the panic, the shortage of equipment,” Mr. Shi said. “We just realized the situation is very serious — more serious than we thought.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-5f373b90">Fears Spread</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Through messages on the WeChat messaging service, Chinese-Americans have a personal window into the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/china-social-media-coronavirus.html" title="">fears and uncertainty</a> spreading through the Wuhan region.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus, which emerged in December, has now spread to other countries. But the majority of the nearly 1,300 infections reported, and all 41 of the deaths from the illness, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-maps.html" title="">have been in China</a>. Authorities shut down transportation out of Wuhan, hoping to contain the spread of the virus, and have since expanded the lockdown to other cities, covering a total population of about 35 million.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Lunar New Year celebration often sends families traveling within China and around the globe. Mr. Shi said the illness had disrupted some of those plans, keeping families apart.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Long Wu, a 68-year-old retiree in Pasadena, Calif., said she had bought tickets to fly back to China in March. But she has now canceled her plans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s better to put your health first,” Ms. Wu said. “My whole family canceled their tickets.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jack Huang, a 76-year-old businessman in Rowland Heights, Calif., said he was worried about how easily the virus could spread in the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am really hesitant on meeting clients coming in directly from China, especially hearing about the mass quarantines,” Mr. Huang said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In New York, Ms. Lee-Ludovicy said her children had been excited at the prospect of the field trip to Chinatown, planning to go with a group of other students who are studying Mandarin.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the trip canceled, Ms. Lee-Ludovicy said, she and her family planned to drive to the celebrations on their own.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But she worried that her two children, a daughter in middle school and a son in high school, were facing discrimination in ways they had not before. And she wondered what other students were taking away from the experience.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Kids are not being educated,” she said. “They are being taught, ‘Let’s just stay away from them.’”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-219c1735">‘They’re Sold Out’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Flushing, the streets and storefronts this week were lined with vendors selling Chinese wall hangings and red envelopes decorated with images celebrating the Year of the Rat. Hurrying through the crowds was a woman with a brown fur hat and a white paper face mask in search of masks for her relatives in Fujian Province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She stopped at one drugstore after another, repeatedly asking, “Do you carry face masks?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Everywhere I go they’re sold out,” said the woman, who identified herself only by her surname, Zheng. “How could this be?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Zheng, 68, said she was worried that her family in Fuzhou, Fujian — though far from the epicenter of the outbreak — could be in danger.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the fifth pharmacy she visited, Ms. Zheng finally found surgical masks for $2. She bought five.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scenes like this unfolded across Chinese enclaves around New York. Some store managers said wholesalers were not able to keep up with demand.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Daniel Xu, a pharmacist and manager at Starside Drugs in Flushing, said a customer came in on Monday and completely bought out his stock.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“All of a sudden we were out, and then hundreds of people started coming in asking for face masks,” Mr. Xu said. He said they restocked as much as they could before their distributor started rationing.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-7dda7471">Thousands of Masks</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xu is partnered with Jointown Pharmaceutical Group, based in Wuhan, and has been working to help colleagues in China secure sources of much-needed protective gear for medical caregivers there — surgical face masks, coveralls, eye shields and other medical coverings, including caps and shoe covers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now the problem is not the money,” he said. “Now we need to get the supplies.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, he was in his basement office, juggling phone calls, social media and email to organize efforts from various donor groups, including the Association of Chinese American Physicians.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xu had already secured free shipping through a Chinese airline, he said, and was working on an official channel with the Hubei Province Red Cross to accept and distribute donations of supplies. Struggling to find suppliers, he was brokering deals with factories and importers to secure supplies that had originally been bound for overseas superstores. But resources were still scarce.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now China has to borrow from America,” he joked.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the West Coast, June Liao, the owner of a baby formula export company based in Los Angeles, had amassed 20,000 masks from various sources to donate to Wuhan via the Red Cross. She set up two growing WeChat groups that have collectively raised $48,000 in under 24 hours, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Washington State, Mr. Shi said he and a handful of others, working as part of a group called the United Chinese Americans of Washington, have established a team to coordinate help. He has ordered 100 masks online. But in the meantime, he has been buying from stores, reading the labels to ensure the masks offer what he deemed to be sufficient protection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his WeChat app, he called up a bulletin from officials in Wuhan describing what was needed. While he was not sure if private shipping to China would get through the quarantines, he was hopeful that aid groups would be able to bring in the supplies they are managing to gather.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In the long run, they will figure out how to supply and deliver to there,” he said.

Olival, a biologist and vice president of research with EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit research organization, who has tracked previous outbreaks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the exact path of the pathogen has not yet been established, government officials and scientists said the new contagion had ominous similarities with the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in late 2002, which killed nearly 800 people and sickened thousands more around the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, as the government struggles <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">to contain public anger over the outbreak</a>, it is facing calls to do more to regulate or even ban the sale of wildlife — and growing questions about why so little has changed in the 17 years since SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/world/the-sars-epidemic-the-path-from-china-s-provinces-a-crafty-germ-breaks-out.html" title="">disease</a> was ultimately traced to a coronavirus that jumped from bats to Asian palm civets, a catlike creature prized as a delicacy in southern China, and then to humans involved in the wildlife trade there. According to officials and scientists, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html" title="">the new virus also appears to have originated in bats</a> and made the jump to another mammal, though which one is not yet clear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The latest outbreak — the scope of which is still unfolding — has led to calls inside and outside of China for better regulations or even an end to this kind of culinary adventurism. While turtle and boar meat are not uncommon in Chinese restaurants, game meats such as civet cats, snakes or pangolins tend to be considered specialties only in some regions. Their consumption is driven as much by the desire to flaunt wealth as by a mix of superstition and belief about the health benefits of wildlife.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was identified as the most likely source of this outbreak in December, the authorities promptly closed it, though it was not clear what happened to the animals that had been for sale there. Officials announced only on Wednesday that they had banned the sale of wild animals throughout the province. Two other provinces, Henan and Inner Mongolia, also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://m.xinhuanet.com/2020-01/23/c_1125495548.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">imposed</a> suspensions on the trade this past week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Friday, officials from three national agencies announced tighter controls, including a suspension nationally of the sale and transport of animals possibly linked to the new coronavirus. The statement specified only badgers and bamboo rats, a species of rodent found in southern China that lives in (and eats) bamboo thickets. Both had been advertised for sale in the market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The flurry of government action came after an unusual outpouring of public sentiment against the trade of live animals. A campaign on Weibo, the social media platform, drew 45 million views with the hashtag #rejectgamemeat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Eating game does not cure impotence or have healing powers,” Jin Sichen, a television presenter in Nanjing, a city in southeastern China, wrote <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.weibo.com/1863716232/IqGcXwuXm?from=page_1005051863716232_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">on his Weibo page</a> on Wednesday. “Game not only doesn’t cure disease, it can also make you, your family, friends and even more people sick.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“One must be mentally sick to eat game in order to show off and flaunt,” Mr. Jin added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A group of 19 Chinese scholars also called on the government to do more to regulate the trade and the public to stop eating wild animals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wildlife Conservation Society, an advocacy organization based in New York, called for a global ban on the commercial sale of wildlife, especially in markets like those in China, saying that the latest outbreak proved the public health threat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Christian Walzer, the organization’s executive director of health, said that the astonishing diversity of wild animals in markets like these, packed in small cages in crowded market stalls, created a perfect laboratory for the unintentional incubation of new viruses that can enter human cells. Viruses can be spread through saliva, blood or feces.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Each animal is a package of pathogens,” he said in a telephone interview.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But some Chinese consumers ascribe traditional medicinal benefits to the animals. Vendors and even officials in state news media have touted wildlife as alternative sources of protein and sources of revenue in impoverished regions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An article by the Xinhua news agency last fall, for example, said that farming bamboo rats was helping to lift people out of poverty in Guangxi, another southern province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Worries about meat supplies surged last year over the outbreak of African swine fever, which led to the killing of 40 percent of the country’s pigs. Production of domesticated livestock on the country’s farms is, compared to the sale of wildlife, subjected to far more regulation and inspection. Outbreaks still occur, but they are identified more quickly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Part of the problem with the wildlife trade is that there is far less regulation, despite the greater risk of live animals’ infecting each other and people, especially in markets that can be unsanitary.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Walzer said that one problem with the legal production of some species is that it can blur the lines between those raised in captivity and those captured in the wild, where unknown viruses have existed for years without contact with humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s a public health hazard, not only in China but everywhere,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the peak of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the authorities banned the sale of civets and culled the existing stocks, but within months they <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/06/world/who-urges-china-to-use-caution-while-killing-civet-cats.html" title="">ended the ban</a> and trade had resumed as before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is driven by interests,” Qin Xiaona, president of the Capital Animal Welfare Association, an advocacy organization in Beijing, said of the current outbreak. “Many people profit from the wildlife trade today.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The trafficking of some wildlife is prohibited, including endangered pangolins, which are prized for their scales and meat, but China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration allows people to raise 54 different animals, birds, reptiles and insects, including muskrat, chipmunks, ostriches, emus and centipedes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Taobao, a popular Chinese online shopping platform, all manner of live wildlife can be had. A baby badger costs 1,300 renminbi, or $187. A farmer from Hunan, the province directly south of Hubei, sells civets, the source of SARS, for the equivalent of $215 each — discounted to $200 if one buys 500 or more.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the sprawling, semi-enclosed market in Langfang, an electronics manufacturing hub south of Beijing, one vendor advertised a live crocodile ($550) and a porcupine ($115). </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, the authorities have not given details about all the animals that were on sale in the market linked to the new coronavirus. People on social media circulated a photograph of a price list for a variety of animals purported to be sold by a vendor in the market, but its authenticity could not be confirmed. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_ZgkquIlUYnix2y7WmKPew" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">medical blog posted</a> on WeChat, the health authorities in Wuhan visited the market in September and inspected eight vendors selling frogs, snakes and hedgehogs, among other animals. All were licensed to sell wildlife, and no violations were found.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the spread of the virus around the country, a Hong Kong television network, I-Cable News Channel, found scores of wild animals still for sale on Wednesday at a market in Qingyuan, a city in Guangdong, the province where SARS originated. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The epidemic has now put sellers on the defensive.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Are you sure it is eating wild animals that has caused the epidemic?” said Zheng Ming, the sales manager of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://shop1429548772861.1688.com/page/offerlist.htm?spm=a2615.7691456.autotrace-topNav.3.7b3573957CJiZ4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a company</a> selling<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>animals in Yichang, a city 180 miles west of Wuhan. Until the ban on sales announced this past week, he sold porcupines, civets, guinea pigs and bamboo rats among others.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We observe the law,” he said. “This is a completely legal business.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">James Gorman contributed reporting from New York.

Wuhan is a major manufacturing center, but not known as a tourist destination.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Travelers to Wuhan are likely visiting friends and family, or are business travelers connected to that city’s manufacturing industry. Most business travelers will have already returned home as the factories recently closed for the Lunar New Year — as is tradition.

Likewise, American Airlines: “While it is not medically recommended, American will allow flight attendants to wear masks on flights to and from Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong,” said Curtis Blessing, an American spokesman, in a statement. The masks are ubiquitous across Asia, but not common in North America.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Paulo Alves, the global medical director at MedAire, a Phoenix provider of in-flight, virtual medical care to airlines and their passengers worldwide, said masks are meant to contain the droplets that someone emits when sneezing or coughing.

China Southern operated direct flights between John F. Kennedy International Airport, San Francisco International and Wuhan. Before the travel lockdown, passengers could have connected in China to Wuhan through code-share partners such as Cathay Pacific, Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The decision behind <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/airports-screening-coronavirus.html" title="">which American airports screen passengers</a> is made by the C.D.C., which last week began scanning passengers for signs of infection at Kennedy, San Francisco International, Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Los Angeles International and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday, C.D.C. officials said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/airports-screening-coronavirus.html" title="">they were expanding the number of entry ports</a> that would screen passengers, to 20 from five. These include ports for both land and air.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Screenings will now take place at <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/quarantinestations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">existing C.D.C. quarantine stations</a>, most of which are at airports. These include the current five airports as well as other ports in Anchorage, Boston, Dallas, Detroit, El Paso, Honolulu, Houston, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle and San Juan in Puerto Rico. Washington Dulles International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport will also have screening facilities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Asia and the United States, passengers are scanned with thermal devices to measure their temperature. Passengers with symptoms such as high fever may undergo additional screening, and even off-site monitoring at specialized facilities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement released Tuesday, the C.D.C. said that the Customs and Border Protection agency would identify all travelers from the affected areas and provide them with a printed health alert notice. The notice provides travelers with information on what to do if they experience coronavirus symptoms within 14 days after arriving in the United States. Immigration officials will refer ill travelers with symptoms specific to novel coronavirus and a connection to China to C.D.C. staff members at the airport for evaluation.</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-750765d9">Should travelers to China cancel their flights?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, the C.D.C. said that Americans should avoid all nonessential travel to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Chinese officials have closed transport within and out of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, including buses, subways, trains and the international airport,” it said in an updated notice. “Additional restrictions and cancellations of events may occur.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas,” it added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The agency <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">maintains a websit</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">e</a> that travelers can check to get the latest recommendations.</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-2833b786">Are tourist destinations in China closed?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the most popular tourist destinations, including the National Museum of China and the Forbidden City (both in Beijing), were closed over the weekend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Badaling section of the Great Wall of China, a popular attraction about 40 miles outside of Beijing, was also closed, as were the Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Park (the hotels at the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort remain open). No date has been announced for reopening any of these sites. In addition, multiday celebrations for the Lunar New Year have been canceled in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan, at the center of the outbreak, lies on the Yangtze River. The river is a popular multi-night cruise route that includes visits to the Three Gorges Dam, which is in Hubei Province. No official announcements on the status of these river cruises have been announced, so travelers who have booked cruises should contact their travel agencies.</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-6e7efcdc">What are cruise operators doing in response?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some cruise lines are rescheduling and canceling trips, while others are increasing screening procedures for travelers embarking at Chinese ports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Costa Cruises, MSC, Royal Caribbean and Victoria Cruises canceled a combined 18 sailings to China, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Cruise Critic,</a> a cruise review website. Costa Cruises, a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, canceled four cruises scheduled to travel to China, and four of its ships are now docked in Chinese ports. Passengers can choose alternative sailing dates before the end of 2020 with a $50 onboard credit, or they can get a full refund.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Royal Caribbean canceled a Spectrum of the Seas cruise, scheduled to sail from Shanghai on Monday, as well as another departure on Friday. The Spectrum of the Seas is one of the largest cruise ships in the world. MSC canceled its Splendida ship from sailing on Tuesday. Both companies said passengers on the canceled sailings were eligible for refunds.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Holland America Line, which is owned by Carnival, changed the disembarkation port for its Feb. 1 sailing on the Westerdam ship, from Hong Kong to Yokohama.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Crystal, Norwegian, Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Silversea added preboarding health requirements for passengers. Norwegian is using “nontouch” temperature screenings for passengers departing from Chinese ports and will not allow anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to board.</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-6fc216ad">What precautions can travelers take?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Those universal things like washing your hands are always recommended,” Dr. Alves said. He also suggested passengers avoid touching their faces, practice coughing etiquette and not cough into the environment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Keep some distance from people who are obviously sick and maintain good personal hygiene,” he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The advice mirrors that given to travelers during cold and flu season. While seat backs and tray tables on long-haul aircraft like those flying to China from the United States are individually wiped down by ground crew between flights, passengers may wish to bring their own wipes for a second pass.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The youngest confirmed case involved a 9-month-old girl in Beijing, according to The People’s Daily, a state newspaper.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Zhou also said that five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, leaving nine million people still living there. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As of Monday morning, the official count of confirmed cases across China stood at 2,744. The authorities in Hubei Province put the death toll at 76 there, bumping the overall deaths to at least 80.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Sunday China announced 15 more deaths from the new coronavirus, including one in Shanghai, the first reported there. Thirteen deaths were announced in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, and one in Henan Province. Across the country, 688 new cases were diagnosed on Saturday, the government said early Sunday.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Deaths from the coronavirus had previously been reported outside of Hubei. But the death in Shanghai, which is among China’s most populous cities and a major commercial hub, is likely to fuel anxieties about the disease’s spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shanghai’s municipal health commission said on Sunday that the patient who died was an 88-year-old man.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-6131399e">A fifth U.S. case has been confirmed.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Three more cases of the coronavirus were reported on Sunday in the United States, two in California and one in Arizona, bringing the country’s total to five, according to the C.D.C.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All three had recently been in Wuhan, health officials said. The three patients were all being kept in isolation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A patient in Los Angeles County passed through Los Angeles International Airport from Wuhan on the way to a vacation elsewhere, Barbara Ferrer, the director of the county’s Department of Public Health, said at a news conference. The traveler returned to LAX on Jan. 22, wearing a mask, and approached airport staff about possibly having the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other California patient, in neighboring Orange County, was identified by the county health agency as a traveler from Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The patient in Maricopa County in Arizona is an adult member of the Arizona State University community, health officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other cases have been found in Washington State and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html" title="">Chicago</a>. The C.D.C. has sent teams to each of the states to help trace and follow up on contacts of the infected patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The C.D.C. said that just over 100 “patients under investigation” from 26 states were being monitored because they had traveled to Wuhan, or had contact with patients, and had symptoms like fever, cough or shortness of breath that could be caused by the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, 25 of those under investigation have tested negative for the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The risk to the general public is considered low, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Sunday at a news briefing. “But the threat is serious,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The C.D.C. is urging the public to get flu shots, to help reduce the number of people seeking treatment for symptoms that might be mistaken for the new coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The agency is also preparing test kits to be sent to state health departments so that they can test for the virus instead of having to send samples to the C.D.C. for testing, but it will be a few more weeks before the kits are ready, Dr. Messonnier said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-2f2f68ca">‘The epidemic has entered a more serious and complex period.’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The head of China’s National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, warned on Sunday that people who carried the disease but did not show flu symptoms could still infect others. That would be a major difference between the new virus and SARS, a coronavirus that spread in China and around the world nearly two decades ago, killing 800 people.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The epidemic has entered a more serious and complex period,” said Dr. Ma, the director of China’s National Health Commission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://xhpfmapi.zhongguowangshi.com/vh512/share/8827546?channel=weixin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said on Sunday</a> that the new coronavirus’s incubation period was about 10 to 14 days, and that the period is contagious.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There have been mild cases where observation has shown that the patients were contagious during the incubation period. The incubation period is around 10 days,” he said. “The shortest time before the disease’s onset was one day. The longest was 14 days. This is very different from SARS.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The rate of the current epidemic is accelerating, he added, and is “likely to continue for some time.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A study by the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673620301549.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">medical journal The Lancet</a>, published on Friday, had raised concerns that people infected with the coronavirus might be able to spread it even if they do not have flulike symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials in the United States expressed some caution on Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t have any clear evidence of patients’ being infectious before symptom onset,” Dr. Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said at a news briefing on Sunday. “We are actively investigating that possibility.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Spread of the virus by people with no symptoms would make the disease harder to control — if that really is occurring, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director who is now president of Resolve to Save Lives, a public health organization. “We don’t know,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he had seen no data to indicate that people with no symptoms were contagious.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We surely haven’t seen that with any of the other coronaviruses, MERS or SARS,” Dr. Osterholm said. “When we could document transmission, patients were ill.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, “Mother Nature is throwing us a curveball with this outbreak, but we shouldn’t accept every claim like this until we see the data.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Julie Gerberding, another former C.D.C. director and now chief patient officer at Merck, said the spread by asymptomatic people was not impossible. Seemingly asymptomatic people could have the sniffles, she said, which might go unnoticed but spread the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The U.S. has faced multiple pandemics before,” Dr. Messonnier said. “We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I hope it’s not.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If people with no signs or symptoms of illness can spread the infection, that “offers many more opportunities for spread, and increases the difficulty of curtailing the spread greatly, because you can’t just focus on sick individuals,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If an exposed person becomes contagious before they become sick, you can almost think of them as a secret spreader,” he said. “They’re healthy. Nobody suspects they’re sick. Nobody’s avoiding them, and they’re not staying home with their illness.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added: “SARS was largely transmitted from people who were already sick. Ebola was the same. If you were exposed, you were of no risk to anyone until you became sick, and even in the early day or two or three of illness you were not of risk to anyone.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-71fc5df3">Hong Kong bars residents from the center of the outbreak.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Hong Kong — which was badly hit by the SARS coronavirus in 2003, with nearly 300 deaths — worries about the spread of infectious diseases run deep. On Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, and people who had been to the province in the past 14 days from entering Hong Kong until further notice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents, according to a government statement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Six cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in the city, already hobbled by months of antigovernment protests.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Its efforts to contain the virus have been met with resistance. A plan to convert an unused public housing block into a quarantine site incited protests on Sunday, with demonstrators setting fires in the lobbies of two of the buildings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government condemned the fires set at the public housing complex, in Hong Kong’s New Territories. But it also backed away from its plan to use the buildings for quarantine, saying that it would use government-owned sites first.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The unrest came a day after Carrie Lam, the leader of the semiautonomous territory, declared a health emergency and said Hong Kong schools would be closed until February. She also said trains and flights between Wuhan and Hong Kong would be halted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Calls had circulated in the past week for new arrivals from the mainland to be barred. Mrs. Lam initially said that would be “inappropriate and impractical” but on Sunday the government changed course on residents of Hubei Province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/wuhan-virus.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">The weeklong Lunar New Year holiday</a>, which began on Saturday, is usually a peak travel period in China. CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, reported that the State Council would extend the holiday three days, until Feb. 2. That would keep people away from workplaces, schools and other public buildings for a longer period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fears about the virus are affecting tourism in the city, whose economy depends significantly on money spent by visitors at malls, hotels and restaurants, and which is now in a recession.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two of Hong Kong’s biggest attractions, Disneyland and Ocean Park, said on Sunday that they were closing until further notice. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hongkongdisneyland.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">A notice on Hong Kong Disneyland’s website</a> called it a “precautionary measure.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shanghai’s Disneyland park had earlier been shut indefinitely. China said on Saturday that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for its citizens headed overseas starting on Monday.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-51350ba0">China halts the trade in wildlife across the country.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China has banned the wildlife trade nationwide until the epidemic passes, three government departments said on Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak has drawn fresh attention <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html" title="">to China’s animal markets</a>, where the sale of exotic wildlife has been linked to epidemiological risks. The Wuhan virus is believed to have spread from one such market in the city. The SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago was also traced back to the wildlife trade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A statement issued by China’s markets regulator, agriculture ministry and forestry bureau said that all transactions of wildlife would be forbidden immediately in wholesale markets, supermarkets, restaurants and e-commerce platforms. It also encouraged consumers to understand the health risks of eating wild animals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The consumption of exotic creatures has been driven partly by beliefs about their supposed health benefits, although such ideas are starting to lose their grip, particularly on younger people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A popular travel blogger, Wang Mengyun, apologized recently for eating bat soup in a video from a few years ago. Ms. Wang, who has more than two million followers on the social platform Weibo, said that she had been unaware of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html" title="">health risks of eating bats</a> when she made the video in the Pacific island nation of Palau. She said she had been trying to highlight the local cuisine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In her post, Ms. Wang emphasized that the bat had been locally raised and was not wild. “Many countries around the world eat these,” she wrote.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her post has since been deleted.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-4c111ae6">Americans in Wuhan will be evacuated to San Francisco.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States government offered details on a plan to evacuate American diplomats and other citizens from Wuhan, saying on Sunday that it was arranging a flight to leave Tuesday bound for San Francisco.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The State Department has ordered all American employees at the United States Consulate in Wuhan to leave the city. In an email sent on Sunday to Americans living in China, the department asked all other citizens who wanted a spot on the plane to contact the embassy. Capacity will be “extremely limited,” the message said, and priority will be given to people at greater risk from the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is unclear who will fall into that category.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jonny Dangerfield, 30, an American who went to Wuhan to celebrate the Lunar New Year with his wife and children, said he hoped his family might be given priority because his three children are all under 5.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If it weren’t for them, we maybe would not have much worry at all,” Mr. Dangerfield, who works in finance in Phoenix and whose in-laws live in Wuhan, said in a telephone interview.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “Just to keep ourselves sane,” he said, “we have low expectations about getting on that plane.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-6da498ba">Global concern grows as the outbreak spreads.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Around the world, health officials worked to minimize the risks for their citizens. France’s health minister, Agnes Buzyn, said Sunday that several hundred natives of France in the Wuhan area would be flown home in the middle of the week but would have to undergo 14 days in quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Russian Embassy was also working with the Chinese authorities <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20200125/1563869649.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">to evacuate</a> Russian citizens from the area, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan told reporters on Sunday that his government would help repatriate all citizens wishing to leave Wuhan, “by charter planes and all other means.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Public health officials in Toronto on Saturday night announced test results showing that Canada had its first “presumptive” case of the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’s associate chief medical officer of health, said the patient was a man in his 50s who returned to Toronto on Jan. 22 after visiting Wuhan. The next day, he was admitted to a hospital with a respiratory infection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, said that additional tests were expected to confirm that the man, who was in stable condition, had been infected with the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Taiwan, which on Sunday confirmed its fourth case, said it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/nfwwGG0nBmQE-W5gBxUTPQ?typeid=9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">bar all visitors from Hubei Province</a>. Taiwan’s government also said it would suspend applications from Chinese citizens for travel permits except in special cases, such as disease control or humanitarian medical assistance.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Macau announced that starting from Monday, it would restrict travelers from Wuhan.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-3583ed4f">Public health experts warn against mass anxiety.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the rising number of coronavirus cases and the dozens of deaths, public health experts say there is no cause for panic. The common flu kills roughly 35,000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200,000 in the United States alone.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet the unknowns around the current outbreak are causing widespread worry. And there are signs that this outbreak could be more serious than the common flu. Other coronaviruses have far higher mortality rates than the flu, and have led to global outbreaks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition, conclusive evidence about how this outbreak started is lacking. Although officials in Wuhan first traced it to a seafood market, some who have fallen ill never visited it. Researchers have also offered disparate explanations about which animals may have transmitted the virus to humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s record doesn’t help. During the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, officials covered up the extent of the crisis, delaying the response. The Chinese government has promised far more transparency this time, and the World Health Organization has praised its cooperation with scientists.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But mistrust of the local and national authorities, compounded by missteps and mistakes in handling the illness, runs deep. Though China’s initial delay in reporting cases of the new virus may suggest a cover-up, experts see something more worrying: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/coronavirus-crisis-china-response.html" title="">weaknesses at the heart of the Chinese political system</a>.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-18f34ccc">China’s central government deploys hundreds of workers.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a sign that the central government is bolstering its effort to contain the outbreak, China’s National Health Commission <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202001/290e602792b745f2a305ed5836570973.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said it would send</a> 1,230 medical experts to Wuhan to assist in treatment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The army has sent 450 other people from three military medical universities, according to a state media article that the health commission <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202001/a940fa5300ef4e46995e3644f043ce85.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">shared on its website</a>. And the air force sent military transport aircraft to the cities of Shanghai, Xi’an and Chongqing to pick up emergency airlifts of medical teams and supplies for Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, health officials said that they would assign 24 hospitals to treat potential coronavirus patients only, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/1221175912818823168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to People’s Daily</a>, the Communist Party’s main newspaper. National officials had called for patients to be concentrated in specialized hospitals, and new hospitals were being built specifically to treat patients.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-1166b676">A minister pleads for hundreds of thousands more masks.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A top Chinese official warned on Sunday that the nation needs many more masks and protective suits than it can currently produce.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His remarks, in a news conference, came as more local governments around the country mandated that citizens wear masks in public as the coronavirus outbreak grows. On Sunday, the government in Guangdong, China’s most populous province, became the latest to require people to wear masks in public.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wang Jiangping, China’s vice minister of industry and information technology, said that Hubei Province alone needed 100,000 protective suits a day to fight the illness, but that Chinese manufacturers could supply only 30,000 suits each day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Lunar New Year holiday is also making it hard for factories to produce at full capacity, Mr. Wang said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-5b8757bb">‘Every village around here is now putting up barriers.’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Roads were quiet. Where cars, trucks and motorbikes once roared and honked, there was the sound of birds tweeting and dogs barking. Shoppers mostly hauled their baskets home by foot or on bicycle.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan, the city at the center of China’s viral outbreak, has been subdued since the government put it under a smothering net of travel restrictions on Thursday. It was even quieter on Sunday, after the city announced heavy restrictions on the use of cars, even within the urban limits.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But along with general silence, there was confusion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcements about which vehicles were allowed on the roads were murky, leaving even police officers befuddled.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, the Wuhan authorities said that most cars <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?src=11&amp;timestamp=1580035588&amp;ver=2120&amp;signature=SxuKbIMYjrZ4tw2dH2Sf-41vvxx9SlwFgJfynxcr6wjvcfvE4FyGoNh50zGorYJ7JeaFWmsNZELIGwOekOTIi98jPNkDdjwEKebM*JE3TAIdS17Ax5-oi0gQ14Fa6mYW&amp;new=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">should stay off the roads</a> and that a fleet of 6,000 taxis <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2020/01-26/9069778.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">would be on call</a> to transport people in need and deliver food and medicine. Then, the authorities said drivers would be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1656737257191494058&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">notified by text message</a> if they had to stay off the roads. Nobody seemed to receive text messages on Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My understanding,” a police officer said, “is that you can drive in your district if you don’t get a text message telling you that you can’t. But you should check that with the transport authorities.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end, most drivers stayed off the streets. But as the day went on, more ventured out, and the police did not seem to do much about it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For some residents, it was another exasperating fumble by Wuhan officials who many believe have mishandled the epidemic. But most seemed to accept the restrictions with the same stoicism that many have shown since the city imposed bans on leaving for all but a select few.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Sunday morning, many groceries in Wuhan were crowded with residents stocking up, especially on fresh vegetables, fruit and meat, in case even tighter rules might be announced that impeded food supplies or that deterred them from leaving home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Because it’s the New Year, a lot of stores close anyway, and now we have the disease and now this,” said Ai Wenjun, who had lined up to pay for a basket of turnips, cabbage and beans. “Each extra thing makes me worry more.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, shops still have supplies, though some residents said prices had risen despite government warnings to keep them steady.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes. As he spoke, a woman accused him of unfairly raising the turnips’ price.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Every county, every village around here is now putting up barriers, worried about that disease,” Mr. Zuo said. “Even if the government says it wants food guaranteed, it won’t be easy — all those road checks.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For now, the Wuhan city authorities have the benefit of a population willing to endure restrictions to slow the epidemic. But that mood could shift if the measures hamper food supplies and worsen medical shortages.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now is not the time for recriminations,” said Li Xiandu, a retired business manager. “The local government wasn’t forthcoming with information and didn’t take vigorous enough measures.

Such asymptomatic transmissions would make the disease much more difficult to control, as seemingly healthy people travel and interact with others.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The epidemic is now entering a more serious and complex period,” Mr. Ma said during a Sunday news conference in Beijing. “It looks like it will continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s attempts to curb the disease’s spread — essentially cordoning off the major cities in the province of Hubei, including its capital, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people — are a “public health experiment, the scale of which has not been done before,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “Logistically, it’s stunning, and it was done so quickly.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whether the lockdowns will succeed in stemming the spread of the virus is a matter of debate by experts in public health and epidemiology. Some said the lockdowns would help, at least in theory.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Anything that is done that increases social distancing can help decrease the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If you do it right, it’s not impossible it will have positive impact.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But doing it right at this scale has never been tried before anywhere in the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“To put a ring around cities of this size and population is unprecedented,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan and author of the book “Quarantine.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maintaining the lockdown will pose tremendous challenges, starting with the provision of food, fuel and medical care to millions of people. “It’s enormously difficult to do effectively, and also difficult to assess the effectiveness,” said Dr. Schaffner.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other experts were skeptical that the travel restrictions would prove at all effective because they had probably come too late and the barriers would prove too permeable. Five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, said the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang. It was a stunning disclosure that intensified questions about the government’s delayed response.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can’t board up a germ. A novel infection will spread,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “It will get out; it always does.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In China, it was a weekend of grim new warnings about the little-understood virus and a rising tally of infections and deaths. The official number of confirmed infections across China jumped significantly within a span of 24 hours, building to 2,744 by Monday from around 1,975 the day before.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the most recent announced fatalities from the coronavirus was an 88-year-old man in Shanghai — the first death to be reported in the commercial hub, and one likely to fuel anxieties about the disease’s spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New cases cropped up in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Orange County, Calif., bringing to five the number of confirmed cases in the United States. The virus had already been found in Thailand, France, Japan, South Korea, Australia and beyond.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Epidemiologists at Imperial College London </a>estimated that each case infected an average of between 1.5 and 3.5 other people in the early stages of the crisis. For seasonal flu, it’s about 1.3.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That number could drop as the authorities take more stringent measures to halt the spread. But if it holds up, the number of infected could rise sharply.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, the streets were eerily quiet as the authorities had ordered people not to drive, forcing some to walk to hospitals. Mr. Zhou, the mayor, said that health officials were likely to confirm an additional 1,000 cases of the illness in the city. He said that the estimate was based on the assumption that around half of the city’s nearly 3,000 suspected cases of the coronavirus would eventually test positive.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has promised drastic measures to contain the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a signal of the gravity of the crisis, and its likely disruption to China’s short-term growth, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2020-01-27/doc-iihnzahk6491235.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">government announced on Monday</a> that the annual weeklong Lunar New Year Holiday would be extended. For now, at least, many workers will get another three days off, and go back to work on Feb. 3.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even before that notice, Suzhou, a big manufacturing hub in eastern China, declared that factories there should not start back at work any earlier than Feb. 8.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The national government on Sunday also banned the wildlife trade until the epidemic passes. The outbreak had drawn fresh attention <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html" title="">to China’s animal markets</a>, where the sale of exotic creatures has been linked to epidemiological risks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Hong Kong — which was badly hit by the SARS coronavirus in 2003, with nearly 300 deaths, more than any city in the world — worries about the spread of infectious diseases run deep. On Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, and people who had been to the province in the past 14 days from entering Hong Kong until further notice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Six cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in the city, already hobbled by months of antigovernment protests.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials in the United States, in what could turn out to be a positive development in stemming the disease, said there was no “clear evidence” that asymptomatic transmissions of the disease were happening.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t have any clear evidence of patients’ being infectious before symptom onset,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said at a news briefing on Sunday. “We are actively investigating that possibility.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some global health experts said China’s focus, and resources, going forward should not be devoted to closing off cities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, thought China’s approach to the crisis could easily “backfire,” comparing it to the so-called cordons sanitaires that were imposed to seal off swaths of West Africa during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. Those cordons left people starving and spurred violent uprisings. Others routinely found ways to sneak around or through the boundaries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was a disaster,” Dr. Osterholm said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious diseases specialist and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also expressed concern.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you continue to quarantine more and more places in China, you’re going to start to really break normal societal interaction, normal movement of goods and people and medical supplies and food and medicine,” Dr. Inglesby said. “At a macro level, it seems to me that it’s more likely to be harmful than helpful in controlling the epidemic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead, Dr. Inglesby, Dr. Osterholm and other health experts suggested China should concentrate on traditional public health measures that have stopped other outbreaks, like identifying and monitoring contacts and making sure medical care is available to everyone.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even as the highest echelons of China’s government mobilize to fight the illness, much of the task of preventing contagion still falls on local officials, who can be unsure of how to respond to crises and uneven about following through on policies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Sunday in Wuhan, for example, police officers were flummoxed by new restrictions on driving within the city limits.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, the city authorities said that most cars <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?src=11&amp;timestamp=1580035588&amp;ver=2120&amp;signature=SxuKbIMYjrZ4tw2dH2Sf-41vvxx9SlwFgJfynxcr6wjvcfvE4FyGoNh50zGorYJ7JeaFWmsNZELIGwOekOTIi98jPNkDdjwEKebM*JE3TAIdS17Ax5-oi0gQ14Fa6mYW&amp;new=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">should stay off the roads</a>, and that a fleet of 6,000 taxis <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2020/01-26/9069778.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">would be on call</a> to deliver food and medicine. Then, the authorities said drivers would be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1656737257191494058&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">notified by text message</a> if they had to stay off the roads. Nobody seemed to receive the text messages on Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My understanding,” one police officer said, “is that you can drive in your district if you don’t get a text message telling you that you can’t. But you should check that with the transport authorities.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end, most drivers stayed off the streets. But as the day went on, more ventured out, and the police did not seem to do much about it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For some residents, it was another exasperating fumble by Wuhan officials, who many believe have mishandled the epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health experts said the government’s ability to keep the trust of the public was a key element in any successful quarantine, and never easy to do.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Inglesby said that previous, much smaller scale lockdown efforts — including closing off the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak 17 years ago — show that residents may become fearful and lose confidence in the government.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You need people to willingly present themselves for diagnosis,” he said. “If they don’t understand what the government’s doing or they feel in some way their bond with the government has been broken, that’s another key process that’s being interrupted by the quarantine.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For now, in Wuhan, the restrictions seem to be mostly accepted with the same stoic fortitude that many residents showed over the past several days as the city imposed bans on outbound travel for all but a select few.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That mood could shift, however, if, for example, food prices rise. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now is not the time for recriminations,” said Li Xiandu, a retired business manager. “The local government wasn’t forthcoming with information and didn’t take vigorous enough measures. But we need to get through this first, and then we can assign blame.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the government has pledged to build at least two new hospitals with thousands of beds in Wuhan — and to do so in<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title=""> just a few days</a> — the city’s existing hospitals remain intensely crowded, a condition that does not bode well for stopping the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you wanted to create the perfect mixing vessel for a coronavirus,” Dr. Osterholm said, “you’d create the emergency rooms in Wuhan right now.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, Raymond Zhong from Shanghai, and Denise Grady and Roni Caryn Rabin from New York.

Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was only after a brief written statement under Mr. Xi’s name on Jan. 20, when he was touring a military base and shopping exposition in Yunnan Province, that the vast Chinese state bureaucracy began to shudder into action.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials then quickly acknowledged the dangers of the coronavirus and ordered drastic measures to stop the spread — perhaps, experts said, belatedly — including the lockdown of much of the province where the epidemic emerged, penning in 56 million people. The government also ordered the construction of two hospitals in Wuhan to deal exclusively with patients afflicted with the coronavirus, which are expected to open within days, not months or years.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The thing about China is that they can mobilize agencies and resources faster than anybody else can,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/xi-jinping-backlash" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Xi Jinping: The Backlash</a>.” “The other side is that they can conceal things.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In China there is no independent entity that can get on the front foot and disseminate information,” he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From a localized medical mystery a few weeks ago, the coronavirus has erupted as one of the most complex and unpredictable tests for Mr. Xi since he came to power more than seven years ago. Over that time, he has by some measures established himself as the most formidable Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The epidemic and the effectiveness of the government’s response remain subject to many unknowns, but the outbreak comes at a time when Mr. Xi has already been facing quiet whispers about his political acumen. In the past year, he has experienced repeated setbacks on some of the most vital issues on his agenda.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Protests against China’s tightening grip continue to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/world/asia/hong-kong-protest.html" title="">convulse Hong Kong</a>. Rancor with Washington was only partly eased <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html" title="">by a trade deal</a> that some said required China to promise too many concessions. Two weeks ago, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/world/asia/taiwan-election-china.html" title="">voters in Taiwan,</a> the island democracy that Mr. Xi has made clear should join a greater China, resoundingly re-elected a president despised by Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xi’s sheer dominance, according to several experts and political insiders, may be contributing to his problems by hampering internal debate that could help avoid misjudgments. Beijing, for example, has underestimated the staying power of the protesters in Hong Kong and the public support behind them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s a paradox,” said Rong Jian, an independent scholar of Chinese politics in Beijing. “It’s precisely because Xi is so powerful that policy problems often arise — nobody dares disagree, and problems are spotted too late.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While state and local officials <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html" title="">have been criticized</a>, the public health system has been credited with responding effectively, particularly compared to the response to the SARS crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In that case, officials covered up the extent of the viral outbreak for months, almost certainly abetting its spread and exacerbating the death toll, which reached nearly 800.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time, even as officials in Wuhan said nothing publicly, government scientists <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/novel-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">shared information</a> with the World Health Organization on the last day of 2019, isolated the virus, and posted details about it on an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">international database</a> 10 days later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That allowed experts from around the world to quickly conclude that the new coronavirus, like the one from SARS, had very likely originated in bats and made the leap to humans through infection of another mammal in a market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Lancet, one of the leading medical journals, praised China’s handling of the outbreak so far in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30186-0/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an editorial</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The lessons from the SARS epidemic — where China was insufficiently prepared to implement infection control practices — have been successfully learned,” it wrote. “By most accounts, Chinese authorities are meeting international standards and isolating suspected cases and contacts, developing diagnostic and treatment procedures, and implementing public education campaigns.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The journal went on to emphasize that the ultimate success of the response would “depend on maintaining trust between the authorities and the local population.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xi’s government, despite its call to arms, may have already undercut that trust.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the local level in Wuhan, people have vented anger and frustration, which is percolating on social media despite censorship. In widely circulated, and then censored, comments, a senior journalist with The Hubei Daily, the province’s main party newspaper, called for a change of leadership in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With this extraordinarily grim situation worsening and expanding by the day, those currently in office lack that commanding leadership,” the journalist, Zhang Ouya, wrote on Sina.com Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is evidence, too, that the local authorities kept a lid on the crisis in the first days of January so as not to upset the cheerful tone for a provincial legislative session that is a highlight of the local political cycle.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This year will be a major landmark year,” Wang Xiaodong, the provincial governor, told the legislative members. “Let us unite even more closely around the party central leadership with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Wang is now widely accused of underplaying the virus threat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“China is a much more decentralized place than it appears,” said David Cowhig, a former American diplomat who served 10 years in China and monitored health and science issues.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Local officials have great discretion; China is a coalition of ‘little’ Big Brothers,” he said. “Xi realizes this and is trying to re-centralize China.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China, said that the centralization of power since the SARS crisis did not appear to have strengthened expertise at the local level or the willingness of underequipped regional hospitals to report.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think the central health authorities are trying to be more transparent,” he said, “but the local government remains loath to share disease related information in a timely and accurate manner.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not all the blame can fall on the officials in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The central authorities still control the political and propaganda apparatus, which has sought to minimize the severity of the crisis. Before the standing committee’s meeting on Saturday, Mr. Xi and other senior officials went about their business as if there were no crisis, appearing at a banquet on Thursday in the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the Lunar New Year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When he did speak, Mr. Xi emphasized the need for preserving public stability.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The phrase alludes to the fear of popular unrest boiling over, which is, as ever, the party state’s highest priority. It could become a reality if the epidemic, as predicted, inflicts sustained hardship on the economy and people’s livelihood.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The truth is in a public-health emergency, it’s not just the medical professionals who matter,” Mr. McGregor said. “It’s the management of it in the government and in the public that matters, too. It’s hard to argue that they’ve done that well.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Wuhan, China.

President Trump’s legal team </strong>began its aggressive defense in the Senate impeachment trial.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His lawyers, above, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/trump-impeachment-defense.html" title="">dismissed the House impeachment inquiry</a> as a partisan ploy that ignored the facts to cast Mr. Trump’s actions in the worst possible light. Democrats, they argued, were “asking you to tear up the ballots” by finding Mr. Trump guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/trump-lawyers-defense-team-impeachment.html" title="">The president’s legal team</a> on Saturday used only two of the 24 hours allotted to them to present their defense. Arguments will resume Monday afternoon. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Democratic House managers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trial.html" title="">concluded their arguments</a> on Friday, saying that allowing Mr. Trump to stay in office would endanger the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The question of whether the Senate would compel witnesses and documents was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/lamar-alexander-witnesses-impeachment.html" title="">still up in the air</a>, even as new evidence became public: a recording of Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-donors.html" title="">ordering the U.S. ambassador’s firing</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. Bernie Sanders </strong>has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/us/politics/democratic-iowa-poll-sanders.html?" title="">seized the lead in Iowa</a>, a new Times/Siena College poll found. Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden trail him, and Elizabeth Warren lost ground.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The changing fortunes of the two liberal candidates — Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren — underscored the volatile nature of the Democratic primary a little over a week before the Iowa caucuses. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last spring we asked a large pool of Democratic candidates to answer the same set of questions. We did it again, this time with a much smaller group<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>and 20 new questions — on everything from foreign policy to celebrity crushes. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/politics/democratic-candidates-20-questions.html" title="">Here’s what they said</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. Against the backdrop </strong>of impeachment and the 2020 election,<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>the nation’s glaring divisions were on display in the streets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/gun-rally-march-for-life-womens-march.html?" title="">Our reporter went to three protests in one week</a> — the Women’s March, above, a pro-gun rally in Virginia and the anti-abortion March for Life — to find out how polarized politically engaged Americans were. In more than 50 interviews, activists reflected a kind of cultural panic at the thought of the other side winning the presidential election this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So how did we get here? The answer is more about psychology than policy, experts say.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4.

And yet little has changed in the 17 years since: The government now faces increasing criticism and calls to do more to regulate or even ban the sale of wildlife.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. Of the Big Three in men’s tennis, </strong>Roger Federer is the pleaser and Rafael Nadal is the fighter. Call Novak Djokovic the searcher.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/sports/novak-djokovic-australian-open.html" title="">a rare interview</a>, the reigning Australian Open champion said he was no longer playing tennis to prove himself but rather to improve himself and the lives of those around him. He beat Diego Schwartzman in the fourth round overnight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Next up, Daniil Medvedev plays Stan Wawrinka, and Rafael Nadal, who is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/sports/tennis/nadal-australian-open.html" title="">closing in on his 20th Grand Slam title</a>, faces off against the hometown favorite, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/sports/tennis/nick-kyrgios-australian-open.html" title="">Nick Kyrgios</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the women’s court, Coco Gauff lost to a fellow American, Sofia Kenin.

Find your faith.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s Batsheva Dagan, above. Born in Lodz, Poland, in 1925, Ms. Dagan is a survivor of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp and one of a handful of survivors photographed for a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/24/opinion/auschwitz-anniversary-holocaust.html" title="">project in Opinion</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">World leaders and dignitaries will gather for a solemn ceremony at Auschwitz on Monday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camp.

Jeanine Cummins </strong>wrote one of this year’s biggest, buzziest books. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/arts/american-dirt-jeanine-cummins.html" title="">And then she became the story</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even before “American Dirt” — her novel about a desperate Mexican mother and son who flee for the U.S. border after a drug cartel massacres their family — hit bookshelves, a growing chorus accused Ms. Cummins, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/books/jeanine-cummins-american-dirt.html?" title="">who was born in Spain and grew up in Maryland</a>, of having exploited the experience of migrants.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The controversy has grown into a perfect storm of industry hype and accusations of cultural appropriation amid an increasingly charged debate over immigration.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">8. Will Lizzo rule the Grammys as she owned 2019?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She has eight nominations Sunday night, a performance slot and the devotion of fiercely loyal fans.

The most widely used credit rating in the country is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/business/credit-score-fico-change.html" title="">getting a new set of criteria</a>, said Fair Isaac, the company behind it. And for many people, that’s not great news. Those with rising debt levels and overdue payments will be judged more harshly. The new scoring system will also flag consumers who sign up for personal loans — a category of debt that has skyrocketed in recent years as borrowers use it as a stopgap for ballooning credit card bills. The new system is likely to make it harder for struggling Americans to borrow money.

And they have urged those who recently traveled there — or who have been in contact with someone who has — to quickly seek medical care if they have any respiratory or flulike symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s inevitable that we will have someone who is positive with coronavirus,” New York City’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, said Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the last passengers to arrive at Kennedy International Airport on the last direct flights from Wuhan before they were canceled were quarantining themselves at home. One man told of how he had confined himself to his house in Queens, as friends left special Lunar New Year meals on his doorstep.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, state officials have sought testing for nine patients who were deemed potential cases of the new coronavirus, sending samples to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for testing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Four of those patients were found not to have the virus, and the tests involving the other five are still pending, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Monday in a statement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the first case does arrive, health officials said, that patient may end up in a biocontainment unit in Bellevue Hospital or sent home to ride out the illness in his or her bedroom. That will depend largely on how sick they are, public health officials say.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some people with the virus, Dr. Barbot said, have limited symptoms: coughing, shortness of breath, a low-grade fever. But in others, the virus can be lethal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside of the city, the state Department of Health has been hosting online seminars about the new coronavirus for medical staff. In particular, health officials have engaged in outreach to university health systems, where international students are likely to seek medical care.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By and large, the message to the public has been one of reassurance. “We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives and suggest practicing everyday precautions that we do through the flu season,” Dr. Barbot said.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">How Is the U.S. Being Affected?</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb.10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there is considerable anxiety and debate over the proper precautions within the city’s Chinatowns. That has only grown in the past few days as more alarming news has emerged out of Wuhan about the virus’s spread. So far more than 4,500 people have been sickened and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus-social-media.html" title="">more than 100 people have died</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In response, the authorities in China have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">imposed a lockdown of some 56 million people</a> in cities in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, though by the time it was in effect <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/china-coronavirus.html" title="">some five million people</a> had already traveled from Wuhan, according to Wuhan’s mayor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scott Liu, 56, a textile importer who lives in Queens, said he was on the last direct flight from Wuhan to Kennedy Airport before the flights were canceled last week. He and his fellow passengers learned of the city lockdown mid-flight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He does not think he is sick, but he knows that symptoms take time to appear — the authorities have said the incubation period is up to two weeks, although symptoms seem to usually appear within a week, Dr. Barbot said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the meantime, Mr. Liu has confined himself at home alone, even at the start of Lunar New Year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead of going out to visit friends and family or sharing holiday meals, Mr. Liu stood behind his door as friends dropped off traditional Hubei dishes for Lunar New Year on his doorstep — lotus root and pork rib soup, salted fish and dumplings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Liu said he did not think he was overreacting, just acting responsibly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For us, this is very serious,” he said in Mandarin during a phone interview on Friday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Liu was among a few hundred members of the New York Yellow Crane Club who had traveled to Wuhan several weeks ago to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the seriousness of the outbreak became apparent, Mr. Liu, who is the club’s president, and a few others cut short their plans and boarded flights home. Mr. Liu arrived in New York on Wednesday, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As of Monday, Mr. Liu said he had not experienced any symptoms: “So far, so good.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, the Yellow Crane Club, which has more than 500 members of mainly immigrants from Wuhan and their families, hosted a Lunar New Year celebration at a banquet hall in Flushing, Queens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year, Mr. Liu said, “all the events here are canceled. Everybody is in a state of panic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For now, Mr. Liu spends his days staring at his phone, reading the news about the virus and messaging friends. His wife is visiting their daughter in Florida. He worries about his 90-year-old mother, who lives alone in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most of his friends who had recently returned from Wuhan had also put themselves under quarantine. Some were urged by family members to confine themselves to a single bedroom so as to reduce the risk of transmission should they become ill.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are friends and families that require family members to quarantine themselves — that force them,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Barbot said that those who have recently traveled from Wuhan are not being urged to self-quarantine or avoid large public gatherings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are very clear: We wish New Yorkers a Happy Lunar New Year and we encourage people to spend time with their families and go about their celebration,” Dr. Barbot said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent days, Lin Qiurong, 40, who emigrated from China’s Fujian province in 2002, had been weighing messages from friends, urging each other to avoid large crowds. But on Sunday, Ms. Lin and her three teenage children donned surgical face masks and ventured out to a Lunar New Year parade in Sunset Park, home to Brooklyn’s largest Chinatown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s an event that the community looks forward to every year: Giggling children spray each other with canned silly string while lion dance troupes undulate and swerve to the beat of a pounding drum and clanging cymbals. Traditional New Year’s music blasts from large speakers mounted atop a fleet of passenger vans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There was still all that. Though as Ms. Lin walked down Eighth Avenue, ahead of the parade, she sized up the crowd, and could not shake the impression that there were fewer spectators lining up than in years past.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Look around,” Ms. Lin said, speaking in Mandarin, noting that while there were plenty of vendors standing behind tables of confetti cannons and silly string, actual spectators seemed to be in short supply. “It’s much emptier compared to last year,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Louie Liu, 47, a member of a neighborhood patrol group, said he was not concerned about the virus — noting that it had not yet arrived in New York.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I believe the Chinese government will be able to keep it under control,” said Mr. Liu, who emigrated from Fujian province in 1992. He added, also in Mandarin, that “New York State and New York City are also focused and prepared.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New York health officials pointed out that they have a long history of preparing for unfamiliar viruses. As recently as last month, the city’s public hospital system was running drills for how to handle possible Ebola cases. In these drills, individuals claiming Ebola-like symptoms would enter an emergency room, and mention a recent trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-congo.html" title="">which is currently contending with the second largest Ebola outbreak</a> on record.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Barbot said that there is not yet a full understanding of how easily the new coronavirus is transmitted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“All indications are that it’s not nearly as deadly as SARS virus, but the transmissibility is still to be fully elucidated,” Dr. Barbot said, drawing a comparison to another coronavirus outbreak that nearly two decades ago infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Prices have declined about 10 percent since Jan. 17, when China confirmed multiple deaths from the virus. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector was down 2.8 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak has come at a crucial period for Chinese business, which could complicate official plans to reinvigorate growth in the aftermath of the trade-war tensions of the last two years.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-china-economy.html" title="">country’s economy</a>, trying to shrug off its worst slowdown in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/business/china-economy-growth-gdp-trade-war.html" title="">nearly three decades</a>, is already hurting from the virus’s effects on travel and tourism.

Creeping doubts among investors have already helped drive down bond yields in recent weeks. And on Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, considered a gauge of investor expectations for economic growth and inflation, sank to 1.60 percent, the lowest level of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as long as the spread of the virus remains contained, the economic implications should not be dire for the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The American economy is relatively insulated from trade, and the important consumer sector continues to show signs of strength. Unemployment remains near 50-year lows, and economic growth, while relatively slow, is steady. Inflation and interest rates are low, with signs that those low rates are finally starting to filter through to the broader economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With rates on 30-year fixed mortgages below 4 percent, housing has recently picked up the pace.

Despite the symptoms, he was not tested for the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">new coronavirus</a> — a lapse suggesting that there may be far more cases of the virus than are being officially reported.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead, Mr. Xiao was told that he had a viral chest infection, so he went back home. As he grew sicker, he went to three <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-coronavirus-photos.html" title="">other hospitals</a>. But they told him they did not have enough beds.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like many of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html" title="">thousands of Chinese patients</a> who are concerned about the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">new coronavirus</a>, Mr. Xiao is scrambling to get help from a health care system straining to serve even the basic needs of patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is like kicking a ball from here to there,” said his wife, Feng Xiu.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xiao, who was eventually hospitalized on Sunday — about a week after his initial attempt — still hasn’t been tested for the pneumonialike virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it struggles to combat a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">coronavirus outbreak</a> that has sickened more than 4,500 people and killed 106, the Chinese government is relying on a medical system that is overburdened and overwhelmed even in normal times. While other parts of everyday life in China have significantly improved in the past decade, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/business/china-private-hospitals-putian.html" title="">quality of health care</a> has stagnated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, many people have to stand in line in the wee hours of the morning to secure appointments with doctors. When they do get an appointment, patients get only a couple of minutes with a doctor. During flu season, residents set up camp overnight with blankets in hospital corridors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China does not have a functioning primary care system, so most people flock to hospitals. On an ordinary day, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/business/china-health-care-doctors.html" title="">doctors are frustrated</a> and exhausted as they see as many as 200 patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China — like Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite having dealt with the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago, many Chinese hospitals in smaller cities are not fully prepared to deal with a major outbreak like the current virus. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in poorer, rural areas nearby.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, eight hospitals in Hubei Province — where Wuhan is situated and where most of the cases have appeared — put out a call for N95 masks, goggles, surgical masks and surgical gowns. In the absence of proper equipment, some medical workers have resorted to cutting plastic folders to jury-rig goggles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China had invested a lot in building a robust public health infrastructure in the wake of SARS and that many of them were mostly well equipped to deal with infectious diseases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But they apparently didn’t anticipate something so sudden, so acute and so tremendous,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government’s response to the crisis could <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html" title="">exacerbate the problems</a>. Across China, the authorities are sealing off cities, closing down schools and checking on residents. But the lockdown — affecting 56 million people — could make it difficult to get medical supplies to hospitals that desperately need them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese officials have acknowledged that they are struggling to deal with the outbreak. At a news conference last week, the Wuhan health commission said there were long lines and a shortage of beds. In response, it said it had designated hospitals as “fever clinics” for people to go to for treatment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With medical facilities in short supply, the local government has also pledged to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days, and vowed that another new 1,300-bed hospital would be ready by the middle of next month. It is taking a page out of the government’s playbook during SARS, when it built a new hospital in Beijing in just a week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet it is still not clear that there will be sufficient beds to deal with the virus, which remains highly contagious.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said it was more important to have a working system of family doctors who can act as gatekeepers for the hospitals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Without an efficient screening process,” he said, “these two hospitals would not be very effective.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The central government is under increasing pressure to show that it is adequately coping with the crisis. On Monday, Premier Li Keqiang, who has been assigned to oversee the national response to the outbreak, visited Wuhan to inspect efforts to contain the disease. He pledged to provide local health centers with 20,000 pairs of safety goggles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the government scrambles to contain the outbreak, the sick are just trying to get medical attention.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cai Pei, 41, of Wuhan, said his wife had begun coughing and developed a fever three days ago. He wrote on Weibo, a popular social media platform, that hospitals would not admit her, and that he had difficulty finding masks and cold medicine in pharmacies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Making matters worse, three Chinese medical companies have said that they do not have the capacity to make enough test kits for the new coronavirus, according to local news media reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cai and his wife still do not know whether she is infected with the coronavirus or another more common ailment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Sometimes I can only hide and cry, but I couldn’t tell her and had to reassure her that it is not the virus,” Mr. Cai said by telephone. “It is very scary. If it’s real, we have a child and elderly parents at home. What if we all get sick?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With no proven drugs to treat the new virus, the health authorities have told doctors to prescribe a combination of treatments — anti-viral H.I.V. drugs as well as traditional Chinese medicine — to patients. Some of the medicines being prescribed are a mixture of ingredients like buffalo horn, jasmine and honeysuckle as well as anti-viral H.I.V. drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As happened with SARS, traditional Chinese medicine — an industry that the government has pledged to develop — is prominently being touted as a way to treat this new coronavirus. But there is no clinical evidence that the gallstones of cattle, the roots of plants and licorice could work in combating it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Journals have published studies by Chinese scientists saying that traditional Chinese medicine helped alleviate symptoms of SARS. China’s ministry of science and technology said in 2003 that it had found banlangen, the root of the woad plant, as well as a liquid made up of ingredients like cholic acid, jasmine, buffalo horn and honeysuckle to be effective in curing an acute inflammation of the lungs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There has never been a good antiviral agent, so that means that people would try things that have some effect,” said Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist at the University of Sydney. “But there’s no evidence of significant benefits with any antiviral drugs or traditional Chinese medicine.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The problem with finding a drug that can effectively fight an infectious disease like this coronavirus, SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is that it needs to be tested in sufficient numbers in a randomized way in proper clinical trials. Patients must also give informed consent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That is very difficult in an outbreak situation,” said Kanta Subbarao, a senior researcher on respiratory illnesses at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, Mr. Xiao’s daughter, Xiao Hongxia, said her father had been diagnosed with severe pneumonia and was now labeled a “highly suspicious case.” He is relying on ordinary fever medicines and anti-inflammatory drugs, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is no special medicine for the coronavirus so far,” Ms. Xiao said, “so we can only rely on the patient’s own immunity.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Amber Wang, Yiwei Wang and Elsie Chen contributed research.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The specter of open hostilities between the United States and Iran had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/world/middleeast/trump-speech.html" title="">reverted to stalemate</a>. Though Europe remained stagnant, Germany — the Continent’s largest economy — had escaped the threat of recession.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, the world is worrying anew.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An outbreak originating in China and reaching beyond its borders has summoned fresh fears, sending markets into a wealth-destroying tailspin. It <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/coronavirus-financial-markets.html" title="">has provoked alarm</a> that the world economy may be in for another shock, offsetting the benefits of the trade truce and the geopolitical easing, and providing new reason for businesses and households to hunker down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, investors dumped stocks on exchanges from Asia to Europe to North America. They entrusted their money to traditional safe havens, pushing up the value of the yen, the dollar and gold. They pushed down the price of oil over fears that weaker economies would spell less demand for fuel.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In short, those in control of money took note of a growing crisis in a country of 1.4 billion people, whose consumers and businesses are a primary engine of economic growth around the world, and they chose to reduce their exposure to risk.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By late Monday, the virus had killed more than 100 people in China. More than 4,500 had been infected — mostly in mainland China, but also in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, and as far away as Australia, Canada and the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The emergence of the virus in China, whose government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://cpj.org/blog/2019/03/journalists-jailed-china-censored.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">jails journalists</a> and tightly controls information, left the world uncomfortably short of facts needed to assess the dangers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s the uncertainty of how the global economy is going to respond to the outbreak,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, a specialist bank in London. That will depend on the severity, the spread and the duration of the outbreak, he said, and “we don’t really know the answers to any of these questions.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What was left to the imagination resonated as a reason for investors to unload anything less than a sure thing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stocks in Japan and Europe fell more than 2 percent. In New York, the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.6 percent, with stocks of companies whose sales are dependent on China especially susceptible. Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos in the gambling haven of Macau, a special administrative region of China, dropped more than 8 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus and its attendant unknowns conjured memories of another deadly illness that began in China, the 2002-3 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> killed nearly 800 people</a>.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In many ways, it looks similar,” said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “We are seeing fast increases in the number of cases. The hospitals are overwhelmed and are not even able to test people with symptoms. I’m expecting the cases to go way, way up.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end, SARS significantly slowed the Chinese economy, dropping the annual growth rate to 9.1 percent in the second quarter of 2003 from 11.1 percent in the previous quarter, according to Oxford Economics, an independent research institute in London.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The episode is coinciding with the Lunar New Year, a major holiday in which hundreds of millions of Chinese journey to their hometowns to visit relatives.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With air, rail and road links in central China restricted as the government seeks to block the spread of the virus, hotels, restaurants and other tourism-related businesses are likely to suffer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some economists assume that those effects will quickly dissipate, leading to a revival in the consumer economy within months. That is how events played out in 2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our baseline is that it will be a fairly big impact but relatively short-lived,” said Louis Kuijs, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the hopeful view, economic damage will be contained by the Chinese government’s aggressive response in effectively quarantining the outbreak’s center — Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and much of the surrounding area in Hubei Province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Wuhan is a hub of industry, sometimes called the Chicago of China, intensifying the quarantine’s implications for the national economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is really unprecedented,” Mr. Lardy said. “The economic effects may be much larger than SARS. Wuhan is a major industrial city, and if you’re basically shutting it down, it’s going to have a major effect.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Already, China’s government has extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days, through Feb. 2, ensuring that migrant workers will not return to their factory jobs as soon as anticipated, almost certainly disrupting production. Suzhou, a major industrial city near Shanghai, has extended the holiday until at least Feb. 8.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given that China’s economy is the source of roughly one-third of world economic growth, the slowdown could be felt widely.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most directly, China’s neighbors would absorb the effects, especially those dependent on tourists from China — among them Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Over the weekend, China announced that it was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">barring overseas group tours</a> by its citizens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If China’s factories are hobbled by additional restrictions on transportation that limit factory production, that could become a global event. It could hit iron ore mines in Australia and India that feed raw materials into China’s smelters. It could limit sales of computer chips and glass panel displays made at plants in Malaysia and South Korea.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It could trim sales of factory machinery produced in Germany and auto parts made in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. It could even affect the purchases of additional American farm goods that China agreed to under the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html" title="">trade deal</a> signed this month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The shock is hitting just as China contends with its slowest pace of economic growth in decades, reviving fears that its reduced appetite for the goods and services of the world could jeopardize jobs on multiple shores.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“China is obviously slowing down in a structural way,” said Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management in London. “The global economy is clearly more shaky, with sluggish growth. It is clearly more vulnerable to shocks.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SARS outbreak prompted the government to stimulate the Chinese economy by directing surges of credit that financed huge infrastructure projects. But whatever damage China confronts this time, its willingness to respond will be limited by the government’s concerns about mounting public debt.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They are much more constrained now,” said Mr. Lardy, the China expert. “I think people underestimate the conviction that the top leadership has, that they really want to reduce financial risk.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as global investors try to gauge the outlook, one element is the same as ever in China: Information is scarce. Trust in the authorities is minimal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the SARS outbreak, the government was slow to acknowledge the existence of the virus as local officials actively covered up cases, allowing the threat to multiply.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time, the government has sought to project the sense that it is forthrightly reckoning with the crisis. President Xi Jinping has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/china-coronavirus-xi-jinping.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes" title="">publicly acknowledged the threat</a>, while warning local officials not to hide reports of trouble.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in the current moment of agitation, any perceived lack of information tends to weigh in as bad news.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is, of course, still a government system where transparency is not really held up as an important criterion,” Mr. Kuijs of Oxford Economics said. “This is still an overall system in which discretionary decisions by bureaucrats are driving everything instead of very clear rules.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Clifford Krauss and Matt Phillips contributed reporting.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

And they have urged anyone who recently traveled there — or who have been in contact with someone who has — to quickly seek medical care if they have any respiratory or flulike symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, of nine patients for whom New York State officials have sought testing from the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, four were found not to have the virus, and the tests involving the other five are pending, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Monday in a statement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the first case in New York does arrive, health officials said, that patient may end up in a biocontainment unit in Bellevue Hospital or sent home to ride out the illness in their bedroom.

She was in isolation at home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man is in his 50s and is now in stable condition. Laboratory tests confirmed that he was infected with the new coronavirus, and tests are pending for his wife, officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials are now tracking down people who sat near the couple on a flight to Toronto from Guangzhou, and questioning the travel history of people seeking medical help for respiratory problems around Ontario, Dr. Yaffe said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-29ab6cb5">Social media users criticize the Chinese government’s response.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government usually keeps a tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html" title="">criticism on social media</a> over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been difficult to contain.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some critics of the government have found clever ways to dodge censors, such as referring to Xi Jinping as “Trump” or comparing the outbreak to the Chernobyl catastrophe.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The vitriol has been most intense in Hubei, the home province of Wuhan. After the provincial governor, Wang Xiaodong, gave a news briefing on Sunday, online commenters mocked Mr. Wang for misstating the number of face masks that the province could produce.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They also circulated a photo from the briefing of him and two other officials, pointing out that one of them did not cover his nose with his mask. Another wore his mask upside down, and Mr. Wang did not wear a mask at all.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-4060c50">The crisis has turned a spotlight on China’s overburdened health system.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese health care system strains to serve patients even under normal circumstances. Those weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/27china-coronavirus-health.html" title="">like Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in nearby rural areas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said China had invested a lot in building infrastructure to deal with infectious diseases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But they apparently didn’t anticipate something so sudden, so acute, and so tremendous,” he said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-1843ec90">Some public health experts are skeptical of China’s efforts to contain the virus</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s efforts to contain the spread of the disease by keeping tens of millions of people corralled in the major cities in Hubei Province have drawn skepticism from some experts in public health and epidemiology.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lockdown will pose tremendous challenges, starting with getting food, fuel and medical care to those affected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“At this stage of the outbreak, the things that make the most difference are finding people, diagnosing people, and getting them isolated,” said Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious diseases specialist and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you isolate the city, then my question and my concern is that you’re making it harder in a number of ways to do those things you need to do,” including getting sick people to the hospital and getting supplies into medical facilities, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other experts said that the travel restrictions had probably come too late and that the barriers would prove too permeable. Five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, said the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can’t board up a germ,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. “A novel infection will spread.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some experts, however, said the lockdowns could help, at least in theory.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Anything that is done that increases social distancing can help decrease the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If you do it right, it’s not impossible it will have positive impact.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-44aeed45">Hong Kong hospitals in turmoil as workers prepare for possible coronavirus cases.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hospital workers in Hong Kong are trying to prepare for an outbreak of coronavirus cases — with memories of the SARS epidemic of the early 2000s still fresh.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the past week, doctors and nurses have drawn straws to determine when they would work in coronavirus isolation wards for six-week shifts. A hospital rearranged its cafeteria so that all tables faced the walls, a precaution from the SARS era to prevent employees from infecting each other during their meals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SARS outbreak killed eight medical workers in the city. Some still suffer from lung damage 17 years later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many hospital workers are calling for stricter border checks as Lunar New Year holidays come to a close this week, and a wave of visitors and residents are expected to return from the mainland.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A new union, HA Employees Alliance, threatened to go on strike if the government did not close its borders to the mainland.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Arisina Ma, the president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, called for stricter border checks, and for possibly requiring visitors and residents to stay home for 14 days, the incubation period for the disease, after returning from the mainland.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are waiting for the worst to come,” she added. “Of course we will try to stop it but I am not sure if our government is efficient and determined enough to stop the worst to come.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, the city’s hospitals are still reeling from the anti-government protests that flooded their wards with patients over the past seven months.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early Monday morning, hours after protesters set fire to unused public housing units designated to be medical quarantine areas, a handmade bomb exploded inside a hospital toilet cubicle, a police official said. The two small explosions filled the emergency ward with smoke but caused no injuries.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-15538d14">Wuhan mayor claims responsibility and offers to resign.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan’s top government and Communist Party officials offered to step down on Monday amid growing criticism in the city that the local authorities’ response to the outbreak was too slow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mayor Zhou Xianwang said in an interview with the state broadcaster CCTV that he and Ma Guoqiang, the city’s party secretary, would take responsibility for the crisis and resign to “appease public indignation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our names will live in infamy, but as long as it is conducive to the control of the disease and to the people’s lives and safety, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will bear any responsibility,” Mr. Zhou said in the interview.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Medical workers in the city have accused the local government of reacting too slowly to the crisis, and residents have used social media to complain about a ban on travel that has made it difficult to get access to food and health care.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mayor defended the travel ban, which was enacted last week and effectively cut off the city of 11 million people. He called the restriction “unprecedented in human history.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-4b8c0af4">China’s No. 2 official visits Wuhan as anger at the government grows.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s second-highest ranking official, Premier Li Keqiang, on Monday visited Wuhan to inspect local efforts to contain the disease, the government said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In pictures released by the state-run news media, Mr. Li is seen wearing a face mask and a blue protective gown while posing for photos with health workers. He was also seen speaking with a patient in an isolation ward via video conference.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The premier’s visit comes as the central government is under increasing pressure to prove it is adequately coping with the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Saturday, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, convened a meeting of the Politburo’s standing committee, the senior-most executive body of the Chinese Communist Party, as a demonstration of the government’s hands-on approach to the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hospitals in Wuhan have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. Mr. Li, who has been assigned to oversee the national response to the outbreak, pledged to provide Wuhan’s health centers with 20,000 pairs of safety goggles.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-e72f7d6">China extends long Lunar New Year holiday to limit travel.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trying to temporarily limit travel, the Chinese government extended the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday by three days, meaning it will go through next Sunday rather than ending on Thursday. Workers will return to work on Feb. 3.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The holiday, China’s biggest annual celebration, began on Friday, the eve of the Lunar New Year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel during the holiday, either for tourism or to visit family. The week, known in China as Spring Festival, typically includes large public events, but many festivities have been canceled this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many tourist attractions have been shuttered including the Disney theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, along with the Forbidden City and sections of the Great Wall in Beijing.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-49d58eb2">Wuhan residents venture outside only out of necessity or boredom.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents of Wuhan have largely hunkered down to quietly wait out the crisis, mostly staying inside their homes, and venturing out only for supplies and food, medical visits and occasional bursts of exercise away from other people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cities, towns and even villages have erected checkpoints and roadblocks intended to ward off any outsiders who might carry the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, most shops remained closed, but supermarkets, fresh produce stores and pharmacies remained open — although many pharmacies have run out of protective masks, hand disinfectant and other supplies intended to protect against the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents with fevers and coughs who worried that they may have contracted the coronavirus continued to line up at clinics and hospitals, but in fewer numbers than on previous days. The streets were mostly free of cars, and many residents walked or rode bicycles to do their shopping.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s possible to live, but it’s not a real New Year,” said Qiu Dongjun, 38, a construction worker from rural Hubei Province who was carrying a bagful of shopping, mostly instant noodles and tins of precooked porridge.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-72a33225">A dark humor emerges on social media.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As health officials race to contain the dangerous virus, social media users in China are responding to the outbreak with dashes of gallows humor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the messaging platform WeChat, people circulated images of improvised face masks made of plastic water jugs. One video on WeChat and the social platform Weibo showed a group of people playing mah-jongg, the popular tile-based game, while wearing what appeared to be plastic bags over their heads.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another video on WeChat appeared to show a person emerging from an airport baggage claim clad in a full-body space alien costume, complete with green skin and bulging eyes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masks are a common motif in virus-related memes. They have been added to traditional greetings exchanged for the Lunar New Year, and photoshopped into classic paintings like Vermeer’s “Girl With a Pearl Earring.” They appear in propaganda posters done in the style of the Mao era and updated to reflect the times.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A video on Twitter appeared to show a taxi driver wearing goggles and a hazmat suit while taking a woman to the airport.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman asks the driver whether his outfit might scare off potential fares. He replies serenely: “Safety first, right?”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-128a01a2">Foreign governments make plans to evacuate citizens.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Foreign governments with nationals stranded in Wuhan scrambled to evacuate their citizens from the epicenter of the outbreak, even as China imposed official travel bans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The State Department said it had chartered a flight to take consular staff members and other American citizens to San Francisco from Wuhan on Tuesday. The department said priority would be given to those at greater risk from contracting the virus because of the flight’s “extremely limited” capacity.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At least one American, a father of three young children, declined the offer after the United States government said his wife, a Chinese national, would not be offered a seat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">France, Japan, Spain and Sri Lanka also said they would bring home nationals. Once in France, evacuated nationals would be required to spend 14 days in quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russia was in talks with China about evacuating its citizens, local news media reported. Russian tour operators have stopped selling trips to China following recommendations from the country’s tourism watchdog and would work only to evacuate travelers, Reuters reported.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> </p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-3dddcf6e">Why is there so much concern?</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the number of coronavirus cases and deaths is alarming, public health experts have so far warned against mass anxiety. After all, the common flu kills roughly 35,000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200,000 in the United States alone.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is too soon to know the mortality rate of the virus in the new outbreak. But there are signs that this outbreak could be far more serious than the common flu.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For one, other coronaviruses have far higher mortality rates than the common flu, and have also led to global outbreaks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese citizens are also haunted by the memory of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, a coronavirus outbreak that also started in China and eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. During that epidemic, Beijing at first played down the crisis and withheld information, eventually drawing widespread criticism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And conclusive evidence about how the outbreak started is lacking. While officials in Wuhan first traced it to a seafood market, some patients who have fallen ill never visited the market. Researchers have also offered disparate explanations for what animals may have transmitted the virus to humans.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-6fdd04bf">Bureaucracy slowed the response to an emerging crisis.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The coronavirus outbreak seemed to be a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html" title="">full-blown crisis</a> by the time the first news reports emerged: Dozens of people had been infected, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-china.html" title="">even some abroad</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though China’s initial delay in reporting cases of the new virus may suggest a cover-up, experts see something more worrying: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/coronavirus-crisis-china-response.html" title="">weaknesses at the heart of the Chinese political system</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s rigid bureaucracy discourages local officials from raising bad news with central bosses, and it silos officials off from one another, making it harder to manage, or even see, a crisis in the making.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s why you never really hear about problems emerging on a local scale in China,” said John Yasuda, who studies China’s approach to health crises at Indiana University. “By the time that we hear about it, and that the problem reaches the central government, it’s because it’s become a huge problem.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those systemic flaws appear to have played a role in the pace at which officials responded to the outbreak, and the country’s inability to address the health risks from its so-called <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html" title="">wet markets</a>, which are stuffed with livestock living and dead, domesticated and wild.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China is now mobilizing a nationwide response involving hundreds of personnel, one of the system’s strengths. But the country’s political weaknesses can have serious consequences for the world. Disease and pollution don’t respect borders, so a unified national policy is typically needed to prevent or stop them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For any health or environmental regulation to work, Mr. Yasuda said, “you want it to be standardized, you want it to be transparent, you want it to be accountable.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Reporting was contributed by Elaine Yu, Russell Goldman, Alexandra Stevenson, Tiffany May, Steven Lee Myers, Vivian Wang, Chris Buckley, Raymond Zhong, Denise Grady, Roni Caryn Rabin, Sheri Fink, Katie Robertson, Sui-Lee Wee, Ian Austen and Karen Zraick.

That came as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged American citizens to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">avoid nonessential travel to China</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Premier Li Keqiang, the prime minister of the Chinese government, flew on Monday into Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to show support for medical workers and to pledge needed medical supplies — only to be mocked online for leading workers in an encouraging cheer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Li’s visit, which featured prominently in state media, came as Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, acknowledged that the local authorities had moved too slowly in the first days of the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In an interview with CCTV, the main state television network, the mayor said that information about the coronavirus had not been shared with the public in a timely manner, and that he and the city’s Communist Party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, were prepared to resign to “appease public indignation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our names will live in infamy for shutting the door” of the city, Mr. Zhou said. “But we believe that as long as it helps to control the disease, helps keep people’s lives safe, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will shoulder any responsibility,” Mr. Zhou said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The offer to resign, which was not immediately acted on, suggested that China’s harshly practical party hierarchy could settle on local officials like the mayor and the party secretary as sacrifices to ease public ire over a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/china-coronavirus-xi-jinping.html" title="">spiraling public health crisis</a> that also threatens to take a large economic toll.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the death toll rising to at least 106, and infections spreading to still more countries, the impacts reverberated globally. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/stock-market-today.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Stocks tumbled and oil prices fell on Monday</a> as the virus’s spread worried investors worldwide.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.6 percent, its sharpest decline in nearly four months, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Major stock benchmarks in Europe were down more than 2 percent. While many markets in Asia were closed for the holiday, Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index sank 2 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s currency also fell, while investors moved into safe havens like gold.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In China, the government announced that it would extend for three days the weeklong holiday for the Lunar New Year, which had been scheduled to end on Thursday. The country’s economy, which is experiencing its worst slowdown in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/business/china-economy-growth-gdp-trade-war.html" title="">nearly three decades</a>, is already hurting from the impact of the outbreak, and there are fears that consumer spending will fall as residents stay home over the extended holiday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Beijing, where 72 cases had been reported by Monday morning, officials warned that anyone who returned to the city from other parts of China must confine themselves to their homes for 14 days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That could significantly reduce the city’s work force even after the extended holiday ends. Hundreds of millions of people travel during the holiday, which began on Saturday, and would normally begin returning in the coming days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Shanghai, the country’s financial center, the authorities ordered businesses to stay closed until midnight on Feb. 9. In nearby Suzhou, a large manufacturing hub, businesses there were ordered to open no sooner than Feb. 8. Some companies, including the internet giant Tencent, also told their workers to stay home until Feb. 10.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The epidemic has already shuttered many major tourist attractions, including the Disney theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as the Forbidden City and sections of the Great Wall outside of Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Major film studios postponed the opening of movies at what would normally have been a peak viewing season, while <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://supchina.com/2020/01/26/cba-prepares-for-indefinite-hiatus-due-to-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">several sporting events</a> were canceled or postponed. China’s professional basketball league, the C.B.A., announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The crisis has emerged as an unexpected challenge for the Communist Party leadership, especially for President Xi Jinping, who said nothing in public about the matter until he convened an extraordinary meeting of the party’s Politburo Standing Committee on Saturday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Li, an economist who has been premier since 2013, has taken the formal lead of China’s crisis management team for the epidemic. But the much more powerful Mr. Xi, who is also the Communist Party leader, has signaled that he is the real power in charge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only days earlier, Mr. Li had reflected less urgency about the viral outbreak when discussing it — without wearing a medical mask — while meeting medical workers in faraway Qinghai province.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, by contrast, he made several appearances around Wuhan, visiting a hospital, where he promised to deliver 20,000 surgical masks, and a supermarket, where — now wearing a mask — he led workers in a chant.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Wuhan,” he said. “Jia you,” they responded in chorus, using a phrase that means “add oil” but is roughly translated as a rousing “Go!”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Twitter, which is blocked in China, the gesture was mocked. “Wuhan pneumonia is afraid of slogans,” one user <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/dorjee106/status/1221688326090121221" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">posted</a> in Chinese.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan’s residents have largely hunkered down to quietly wait out the epidemic. They mostly stay inside their homes, venturing out for supplies and food, medical visits and occasional bursts of exercise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, several said they had heard about Mr. Li’s visit and welcomed it as a sign that the central leadership was committed to supporting the city and surrounding areas, which have been locked down since last week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This shows that they’re getting serious,” said Shao Shigui, a retired steelworker from southwest China who was strolling on a promenade by the Yangtze River. He had come to Wuhan with his wife to help their daughter, who is pregnant, and said he was taking a break from the monotony of staying indoors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In China, if a leader visits, that shows that all the resources of the government can be mobilized,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States, Japan, France, Russia and other countries, meanwhile, scrambled to get citizens who were trapped in the city out, after the government shut down the major modes of transportation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since then the city of 11 million has descended into a surreal quiet — except around the hospitals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most shops remained closed, but supermarkets, fresh produce stores and pharmacies opened, although many pharmacies have run out of protective masks, hand disinfectant and other supplies needed to protect against the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents with fevers and coughs who worried that they may have contracted the coronavirus continued to line up at clinics and hospitals, but in fewer numbers than previous days. The streets were mostly free of cars, and many residents walked or rode bicycles to do their shopping.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s possible to live, but it’s not a real New Year,” said Qiu Dongjun, a 38-year-old construction worker from rural Hubei who was carrying a bag of groceries. “I’ve been eating so many containers of instant noodles that my mouth and nose are flaming raw.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said Mr. Li’s visit was a promising political gesture.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People in Wuhan have many practical problems,” he said. “How will our wages get paid? What if businesses go under? Who will ensure we get our unpaid wages? These are practical problems,” he said, his voice partly muffled by his protective mask.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can’t expect all those problems to be solved in Beijing,” he said before walking off.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mayor of Wuhan, Mr. Zhou, defended his actions even as he accepted responsibility for falling short. He said he had been hampered from alerting the public sooner because of the reporting rules under the laws governing disease outbreaks. He suggested he had to wait for approval from higher-level officials.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One woman <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4465451050100687?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">responded angrily</a> in the comments page below the People’s Daily’s live stream of the mayor’s interview on Weibo, the popular Chinese social media platform. She noted that the government had informed the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, but not the public most directly affected until Jan. 20.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Wuhan government will be condemned throughout the ages if it turns the map of China all red,” she wrote, referring to maps depicting the spread of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After weeks of limited steps before the gravity of the epidemic was recognized, government agencies have galvanized to fight the crisis, setting aside other priorities for now.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.cbirc.gov.cn/cn/view/pages/ItemDetail.html?docId=888850&amp;itemId=915" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in a notice dated Sunday</a> that banks “must not blindly call in loans, cut off lending or hold off on lending” in response to the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, State Grid, the government-controlled electricity provider, said it would halt the shut-off of electricity to residents whose bills fall into arrears while authorities deal with the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.

Schools are closed, and traditional celebrations for the Lunar New Year have been suspended. Yet as of Monday, at least 80 people had died, more than 2,740 were confirmed to have been infected and cases had been detected in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-maps.html" title="">at least 10 other countries</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other governments have taken similar measures. Hong Kong has banned the arrival of travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located, and has set up <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scmp.com/video/china/3047578/hong-kong-sets-coronavirus-quarantine-centres-two-holiday-villages" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">isolation centers in two holiday villages</a> to monitor people who have had contact with carriers of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Zhong Nanshan, of China’s National Health Commission, is reported to have said that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-officials-urge-people-not-to-travel-in-and-out-of-city-at-center-of-virus-outbreak/2020/01/21/60680d3e-3c2d-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the most effective way</a> to stop the virus, which appears to be spread by droplets, was a quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Is it, though?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, a city of 11 million, both patients who believe they have been infected by the coronavirus and people with other medical problems are having difficulty seeing doctors: Shortages are common at such times, and quarantines only compound them. Residents are complaining on social media about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/china-social-media-coronavirus.html" title="">inadequate care</a>. Distrust of the health authorities is mounting.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And then, of course, overcrowding at hospitals, which mixes some presumably sick people with the healthy, increases the risks of transmission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some people may have tried to escape the stricken cities for less-infected areas. Others may be hiding from public health workers. A woman from Wuhan, apparently eager to stick to her travel plans for Lunar New Year, reportedly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047334/chinese-told-comply-airport-coronavirus-checks-after-woman?utm_content=article&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1579763656" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cheated a health check</a> by taking fever-reducing drugs to bring her temperature down — and then admitted doing so on social media after she had arrived in France.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An integral failing of most quarantines is that some people, seeing the restrictions as overly strict and an imposition on their rights, will invariably try to bypass them. Their evasion, in turn, can endanger public health.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So, do quarantines contain a disease or might they actually contribute to spreading it?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s health authorities will probably eventually argue that there would have been many more cases had they not locked down cities. But that claim is a negative that cannot be proved. And in my opinion, at this stage, the quarantines decreed by the Chinese government will not help end the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More often than not, health officials are several steps behind a spreading epidemic. And when they aren’t, the history books show, they tend to act too fast (costing a fortune) or unfairly (discriminating against some populations).</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Quarantine laws — from the Italian “quaranta giorni,” meaning 40 days<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>— were first developed in Venice in 1370, to keep the bubonic plague at bay by banning any ships and goods for the time it seemed to take most epidemics to burn themselves out. The measures’ effectiveness then was never studied, yet the practice was refined over time. During the industrial age, for example, European nations reinforced quarantines with “cordons sanitaires” — a ring of armed guards preventing the entry or exit of anyone deemed or feared ill with an epidemic disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the 19th century, many major cities in Europe and the United States had a “lazaretto” — a remote island or containment facility to isolate the sick and those suspected of being sick. Before the advent of effective vaccines, intravenous fluids and other medication, the people who were segregated were rarely cared for, and many died. In numerous instances, too, quarantines were used to separate people considered to be dirty or undesirable.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In January 1892, an epidemic of deadly typhus fever broke out among Russian Jewish immigrants settled in boardinghouses on the Lower East Side in New York City. The local Health Department rounded them up, along with other Jewish residents who happened to live nearby. Hundreds of immigrants — but no other New Yorkers who were ill or suspected of being ill — were quarantined in tents on North Brother Island in the East River. Some contracted typhus as a result of being crowded in with the sick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later that year, New York State’s quarantine officer, William Jenkins, diverted to remote islands hundreds of impoverished East European, Jewish passengers coming from Europe and Asia in the steerage section of ships. The measure was designed to forestall the spread of an outbreak of cholera that had originated in Hamburg, Germany, then the largest port in the world — only it did not apply to first-class passengers. Dr. Jenkins was thought to have overshot, was roundly criticized and eventually lost his job.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 1900, the San Francisco authorities responded to a bubonic plague epidemic by quarantining buildings in Chinatown mostly occupied by Chinese immigrants. They did not, however, quarantine native-born Americans who lived directly across the street. Some doctors claimed the plague was a disease of “rice eaters,” not “meat eaters.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 1918-19 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including up to 750,000 in the United States. In 2007, I led a group of researchers to study <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/articlepdf/208354/joc70085_644_654.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=T&amp;oi=ucasa&amp;ct=ufr&amp;ei=NyguXpvYFpC-yQSizpWIDA&amp;scisig=AAGBfm0KQ36nMkCSF97NGTYf5wA43hKX5w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the use of what we called non-pharmaceutical interventions</a> in America. We looked at 43 large cities that employed some combination of (1) isolating the ill or suspected cases in hospitals or at home, (2) banning public gatherings and, in some cases, shutting down roads and railways, and (3) closing schools.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We found that in the cities that acted early, for sustained periods, and that simultaneously used more than one measure, rates of morbidity and mortality were lower than in the cities that did not take such measures. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">We concluded</a> that in the face of a severe influenza pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions should be considered to complement vaccines, prophylactic medication and treatment — though only as a last resort and only for a highly lethal infection because they are extremely disruptive to society.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2009, during the first days of an H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico, the Health Ministry immediately <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/184560" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">deployed a spate of 1918-style measures</a>. Suspected cases were isolated. Schools were closed. Public gatherings were banned, including a regional soccer tournament.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although those moves did work to limit new cases of influenza, they were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3101203/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">abandoned 18 days later</a>, partly because of the huge social and economic costs. More important, even as the H1N1 influenza virus circulated widely — the outbreak was, indeed, a pandemic — it turned out to not be nearly as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/pandemic-global-estimates.htm?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">deadly</a> as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a garden-variety seasonal flu</a>. (The common flu kills about 35,000 people a year in the United States alone.) The Mexican government concluded, appropriately, that the stringent measures it had adopted should be lifted given the disease’s relatively limited total toll — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202315/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">between 4,200 and 12,000 dead</a> in the end — even if it might keep spreading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early during an epidemic, it may seem reasonable to try to contain it by imposing social-distancing measures as quickly as possible and then release the throttle if evidence suggests those may be overkill. Incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently, tend to work far better than draconian measures, particularly at enlisting the public’s cooperation, which is especially important for properly handling outbreaks in our interconnected, globalized world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, China is adopting classic quarantine measures but on a scale never before seen, let alone studied. Its reaction is perhaps understandable, given the searing memory of the SARS epidemic of 2002-3 and the criticism that was directed at the government for its early attempts to conceal or minimize the extent of the disease. But it may now be overreacting, and after the coronavirus epidemic’s inflection point, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the early days of any epidemic, even as leaders come under great pressure to do something, little critical information is available to make truly informed decisions about the best course of action. At this stage of the Wuhan case, though, the virus has already spread, and according to local authorities, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047720/chinese-premier-li-keqiang-head-coronavirus-crisis-team-outbreak" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">some five million people left the city</a> after the beginning of the outbreak and before the lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given that, China should be prescribing that its citizens remain calm, stay at home if they are sick, practice good hand-washing and respiratory hygiene, and avoid crowded places, if possible. It must also step up health care measures to tend to both the ill and the worried well.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the Wuhan coronavirus, as with other epidemics past, quarantine measures may be too much too late.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Howard Markel is the George E.

The government usually keeps a tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. But the sheer amount of criticism — and the often clever ways in which critics dodge censors, such as by referring to Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, as “Trump” or by comparing the outbreak to the Chernobyl catastrophe — have made it difficult for Beijing to control the message.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent days, critics have pounced when officials in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, wore their protective masks incorrectly. They have heaped scorn upon stumbling pronouncements. When Wuhan’s mayor spoke to official media on Monday, one commenter responded, “If the virus is fair, then please don’t spare this useless person.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The condemnations stand as a rare direct challenge to the Communist Party, which brooks no dissent in the way it runs China. In some cases, Chinese leaders appear to be acknowledging people’s fear, anger and other all-too-human reactions to the crisis, showing how the party can move dramatically, if sometimes belatedly, to mollify the public.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Such criticism can go only so far, however. Some of China’s more commercially minded media outlets have covered the disease and the response thoroughly if not critically. But articles and comments about the virus continue to be deleted, and the government and internet platforms have issued fresh warnings against spreading what they call “rumors.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Chinese social media are full of anger, not because there was no censorship on this topic, but despite strong censorship,” said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, and the founder of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">China Digital Times</a>, a website that monitors Chinese internet controls. “It is still possible that the censorship will suddenly increase again, as part of an effort to control the narrative.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When China’s leaders battled the SARS virus in the early 2000s, social media was only just beginning to blossom in the country. The government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/virus-corona.html" title="">covered up the disease’s spread</a>, and it was left to journalists and other critics to shame the authorities into acknowledging the scale of the problem.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, smartphones and social media make it harder for mass public health crises to stay buried. But internet platforms in China are just as easily polluted with false and fast-moving information as they are everywhere else. During outbreaks of disease, Beijing’s leaders have legitimate reason to be on alert for quack remedies and scaremongering fabrications, which can cause panic and do damage.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent days, though, Beijing seems to be reasserting its primacy over information in ways that go beyond mere rumor control. At <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-01/25/content_5472188.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a meeting this past weekend</a> between Mr. Xi and other senior leaders, one of the measures they resolved to take against the virus was to “strengthen the guidance of public opinion.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wang Huning, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-wang-huning.html" title="">head of the Communist Party’s publicity department</a> and an influential party ideologue, was also recently named deputy head of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-01/26/c_1125504004.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the team in charge of containing the outbreak</a>, behind only China’s premier, Li Keqiang.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese officials seem to recognize that social media can be a useful tool for feeling out public opinion in times of crisis. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging platform, said over the weekend that it would crack down hard on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-01/26/c_1125503796.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">rumors about the virus</a>. But it also created a tool for users to report tips and information about the disease and the response.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Internet backlash may already have caused one local government in China to change course on its virus-fighting policies. The southern city of Shantou announced on Sunday that it was stopping cars, ships and people from entering the city, in a policy that echoed ones in Wuhan. But then word went around that the decision had led people to panic-buy food, and by the afternoon, the order had been rescinded.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nowhere has the local government been the target of more internet vitriol than in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is the capital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the Hubei governor, Wang Xiaodong, and other officials there gave a news briefing on Sunday, web users mocked Mr. Wang for misstating, twice, the number of face masks that the province could produce. They circulated a photo from the briefing of him and two other officials, pointing out that one of them did not cover his nose with his mask, that another wore his mask upside down and that Mr. Wang did not wear a mask at all.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, social media users were similarly unrelenting toward Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During an interview Mr. Zhou gave to state television, commenters in live streams unloaded on him, with one writing: “Stop talking. We just want to know when you will resign.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Top authorities may be deliberately directing public anger toward officials in Hubei and Wuhan as a prelude to their resigning and being replaced. Many other targets within the Chinese leadership seem to remain off limits.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This month, as news of the coronavirus emerged but Mr. Xi did not make public appearances to address it, people on the social platform Weibo began venting their frustration in veiled ways, asking, “Where’s that person?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But even those comments were deleted. So some users started <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2020/01/%e3%80%90%e7%ab%8b%e6%ad%a4%e5%ad%98%e7%85%a7%e3%80%91%e5%9b%a0%e4%b9%a0%e8%bf%91%e5%b9%b3%e4%b8%80%e8%af%8d%e6%95%8f%e6%84%9f-%e5%be%ae%e5%8d%9a%e7%bd%91%e5%8f%8b%e6%80%92%e6%96%a5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">replacing Mr. Xi’s name with “Trump.”</a> As in, “I don’t want to go through another minute of this year, my heart is filled with pain, I hope Trump dies.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other people hungering to express frustration have taken to the Chinese social platform Douban, which has been flooded recently by user reviews for “Chernobyl,” the hit television series about the Soviet nuclear disaster.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In any era, any country, it’s the same. Cover everything up,” one reviewer wrote on Monday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s socialism,” wrote another.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some Chinese news outlets have been able to report incisively on the coronavirus. The influential newsmagazine Caixin has put out rigorous reporting and analysis. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/international/china-media-the-paper-english.html" title="">The Paper</a>, a digital news outlet that is overseen by Shanghai’s Communist Party Committee, published a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_5642907" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">chilling video</a> about a Wuhan resident who couldn’t find a hospital that would treat him and ended up wandering the streets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Xiao, the Chinese internet expert, said the central authorities long gave such outlets special leeway to cover certain topics in ways that official media cannot. But the outlets should not be viewed as independent of the government, he said, calling their coverage “planned and controlled publicity” from the authorities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even outside the digital realm, it is not hard to find people in China who remain unsure of whether to trust what their government is telling them about the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chen Pulin, a 78-year-old retiree, was waiting outside a Shanghai hospital recently while his daughter was inside being tested for the virus. When word of the disease first began trickling out, he immediately had doubts about whether officials were being forthcoming about it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Even now, the government seems to be thinking about the economy and social stability,” Mr. Chen said. “Those things are important, but when it comes to these infectious diseases, stopping the disease should come first.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Li Yuan contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

New Trump revelations shook Washington.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Republicans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-27?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">are in disarray over details</a> that emerged from the draft of a book written by President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Part of the account <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/politics/trump-bolton-twitter.html" title="">dovetails</a> with a central aspect of the impeachment case: that the president wanted to continue freezing security aid to Ukraine until he got help with investigations into Democrats. Mr. Trump denied telling Mr. Bolton that. Here are<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/john-bolton-trump-book-takeaways.html" title=""> five takeaways from Mr. Bolton’s book</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the impeachment trial, Mr. Trump’s legal team — including Ken Starr, arriving above — ignored the Bolton account entirely and doubled down on claims that the president had withheld aid to Ukraine only because he was concerned about corruption there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. Five cases of a new coronavirus</strong> first identified in China were confirmed in the U.S., and scores of other possible cases are being evaluated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">has infected nearly 3,000 people worldwide</a>, with the vast majority in China,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>where the death toll reached 81.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.6 percent, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak began in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China, where anger over the government response has flooded social media. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html" title="">sheer volume of criticism</a> and the ways that critics dodge censors are testing Beijing’s ability to control the narrative.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. When Kobe Bryant’s helicopter crashed, </strong><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/kobe-bryant-death.html" title="">the fog was so heavy</a>, a witness said people were having trouble driving.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Besides the basketball star and his 13-year-old daughter, the victims included a baseball coach, a veteran pilot, teenage girls and their parents. Here is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/who-died-helicopter-crash-kobe-altobelli-chester-zobayan-mauser.html" title="">what we know about them</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The helicopter went down in rough terrain about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, en route from Orange County, Calif., where the Bryant family lives, to Bryant’s youth basketball academy. The L.A. County medical examiner said it could take days to recover the bodies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We’ll be watching a news conference called by the National Transportation Safety Board at 7 p.m. Eastern.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4. The Supreme Court gave a green light</strong> to stricter rules on green cards.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The court’s conservative justices, 5-4, let the Trump administration move forward with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/supreme-court-trump-green-cards.html" title="">plans to deny permanent legal status to immigrants</a> thought to be more likely to make even minor use of public benefits like Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their brief order gave no reasons for lifting preliminary injunctions that had blocked the new program. Challenges to the program will continue to move forward in courts around the nation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The court seems to expect to make a decision on the substance of the policy in the future. “The routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. Why do the polls diverge so much</strong> on Joe Biden?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A week before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders has the lead in the latest state survey — but the former vice president is ahead in national polling.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/upshot/poll-iowa-caucus-biden.html" title="">Our Upshot correspondent explains</a>: Many of Mr. Biden’s supporters are among the most consistent voters. But consistent voters seem uninterested in attending caucuses. And caucuses have an outsized pull on those who do not vote regularly. Above, Mr. Biden in Cedar Falls, Iowa, today.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/politics/iowa-democrats-bernie-sanders.html" title="">traditional Iowa Democrats</a> appear to be split between Mr. Sanders’s four leading competitors or are unsure altogether about who to rally behind — which could open the door for Mr. Sanders to win with a modest plurality.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6. President Trump’s Mideast peace plan</strong> is due Tuesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump, appearing in Washington alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, said the long-awaited plan would be “the closest we’ve ever come” to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-gantz-israel-palestinians-peace.html" title="">an agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That notion was almost unanimously rejected by analysts and foreign diplomats who saw the plan as heavily weighted in favor of Israel. Details were not disclosed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many analysts said the plan was relevant mainly for its impact on the embattled Mr. Netanyahu in Israel’s March 2 election and as a distraction from Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial. Mr. Netanyahu’s opponent in the coming election, Benny Gantz, also met with Mr. Trump.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7.

	The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html">coronavirus outbreak</a> has sickened more than 40,500 people in Asia, according to statements from health officials. Many other cases are suspected but not confirmed. As of Monday afternoon, at least 910 people have died, all but two in mainland China.
</p>, <h3 class="g-caption_heading ">Confirmed cases</h3>, <p class="g-body ">
	As these maps show, the disease has been detected in at least 24 other countries, most involving people who traveled from China.

	The outbreak is believed to have began in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html">seafood and poultry market</a> in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China. The virus is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/health/coronavirus-pandemic-china.html">readily transmitted</a> from person to person, scientists believe. But how lethal the virus is and and whether it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html">can be contained</a> is unclear.

	The Chinese authorities took the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/coronavirus-quarantines-history.html">extraordinary step</a> of closing off Wuhan, canceling planes and trains leaving the city and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. By Jan. 24, at least 12 other cities in Hubei Province had issued travel restrictions, including Huanggang, home to seven million people, and Ezhou, a city of about one million.

	A number of countries, including the United States and Australia, are limiting travel to some people who recently traveled to China, and several major airlines said they expect to halt direct service to mainland China for months.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/health/coronavirus-pandemic-china.html">never succeeds completely</a>, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.

<span class="g-balancer" data-id="18">How big could the outbreak be?</span>
</h2>, <p class="g-body ">
	The true number of cases is almost certainly far larger than the number that have been officially confirmed by lab tests.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Thousands of people in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, are suspected of having been infected but have not been officially diagnosed. Doctors there say there is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html">shortage of testing kits</a> and other medical supplies, and residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat — or even diagnose — the coronavirus.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/health/coronavirus-pandemic-china.html">100,000 or even more</a>. Experts urged caution in interpreting those estimates.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	“These are very early models that make several assumptions based on what evidence is available,” said David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “They aren’t truth — they’re just one step in trying to better understand this outbreak.”

The fast spread of nCoV-2019 — more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">4,500 confirmed cases</a>, including at least 106 deaths, as of Tuesday morning, and the figures will have risen by the time you read this — is startling but not unforeseeable. That the virus emerged from a nonhuman animal, probably a bat, and possibly after passing through another creature, may seem spooky, yet it is utterly unsurprising to scientists who study these things.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One such scientist is Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a senior author of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952v1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the draft paper</a> (not yet peer reviewed and so far available only in preprint) that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name. It was Ms. Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16195424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">showed that</a> the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people. Ms. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a 2017 paper, they set out how, after nearly five years of collecting fecal samples from bats in the Yunnan cave, they had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698#sec012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">found coronaviruses in multiple individuals of four different species of bats</a>, including one called the intermediate <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html" title="">horseshoe bat</a>, because of the half-oval flap of skin protruding like a saucer around its nostrils. The genome of that virus, Ms. Shi and her colleagues have now announced, is 96 percent identical to the Wuhan virus that has recently been found in humans. And those two constitute a pair distinct from all other known coronaviruses, including the one that causes SARS. In this sense, nCoV-2019 is novel — and possibly even more dangerous to humans than the other coronaviruses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I say “possibly” because so far, not only do we not know how dangerous it is, we can’t know. Outbreaks of new viral diseases are like the steel balls in a pinball machine: You can slap your flippers at them, rock the machine on its legs and bonk the balls to the jittery rings, but where they end up dropping depends on 11 levels of chance as well as on anything you do. This is true with coronaviruses in particular: They mutate often while they replicate, and can evolve as quickly as a nightmare ghoul.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a private research organization based in New York that focuses on the connections between human and wildlife health, is one of Ms. Shi’s longtime partners. “We’ve been raising the flag on these viruses for 15 years,” he told me on Friday with calm frustration. “Ever since SARS.” He was a co-author of the 2005 bats-and-SARS study, and again of the 2017 paper about the multiple SARS-like coronaviruses in the Yunnan cave.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Daszak told me that, during that second study, the field team took blood samples from a couple of thousand Yunnanese people, about 400 of whom lived near the cave. Roughly 3 percent of them carried antibodies against SARS-related coronaviruses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t know if they got sick. We don’t know if they were exposed as children or adults,” Mr. Daszak said. “But what it tells you is that these viruses are making the jump, repeatedly, from bats to humans.” In other words, this Wuhan emergency is no novel event. It’s part of a sequence of related contingencies that stretches back into the past and will stretch forward into the future, as long as current circumstances persist.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So when you’re done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one. Or do something about the current circumstances.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Current circumstances include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere. That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis; but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume — with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Current circumstances also include 7.6 billion hungry humans: some of them impoverished and desperate for protein; some affluent and wasteful and empowered to travel every which way by airplane. These factors are unprecedented on planet Earth: We know from the fossil record, by absence of evidence, that no large-bodied animal has ever been nearly so abundant as humans are now, let alone so effective at arrogating resources. And one consequence of that abundance, that power, and the consequent ecological disturbances is increasing viral exchanges — first from animal to human, then from human to human, sometimes on a pandemic scale.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants — and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses. We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The list of such viruses emerging into humans sounds like a grim drumbeat: Machupo, Bolivia, 1961; Marburg, Germany, 1967; Ebola, Zaire and Sudan, 1976; H.I.V., recognized in New York and California, 1981; a form of Hanta (now known as Sin Nombre), southwestern United States, 1993; Hendra, Australia, 1994; bird flu, Hong Kong, 1997; Nipah, Malaysia, 1998; West Nile, New York, 1999; SARS, China, 2002-3; MERS, Saudi Arabia, 2012; Ebola again, West Africa, 2014. And that’s just a selection. Now we have nCoV-2019, the latest thump on the drum.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Current circumstances also include bureaucrats who lie and conceal bad news, and elected officials who brag to the crowd about cutting forests to create jobs in the timber industry and agriculture or about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/49/3/1.2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cutting budgets for public health and research</a>. The distance from Wuhan or the Amazon to Paris, Toronto or Washington is short for some viruses, measured in hours, given how well they can ride within airplane passengers. And if you think funding pandemic preparedness is expensive, wait until you see the final cost of nCoV-2019.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fortunately, current circumstances also include brilliant, dedicated scientists and outbreak-response medical people — such as many at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, EcoHealth Alliance, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.), the Chinese C.D.C. and numerous other institutions. These are the people who go into bat caves, swamps and high-security containment laboratories, often risking their lives, to bring out bat feces and blood and other precious evidence to study genomic sequences and answer the key questions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the number of nCoV-2019 cases has increased, and the death toll along with it, one metric, the case fatality rate, has remained rather steady so far: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahrosenbaum/2020/01/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak/#1c27cb756fce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">at about or below 3 percent</a>. As of Tuesday, less than three out of 100 confirmed cases had died. That’s relatively good luck — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/62/6/555" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">worse than for most strains of influenza</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2000929" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">better than for SARS</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This good luck may not last. Nobody knows where the pinball will go. Four days from today, the number of cases may be in the tens of thousands. Six months from today, Wuhan pneumonia may be receding into memory. Or not.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We are faced with two mortal challenges, in the short term and the long term. Short term: We must do everything we can, with intelligence, calm and a full commitment of resources, to contain and extinguish this nCoV-2019 outbreak before it becomes, as it could, a devastating global pandemic. Long term: We must remember, when the dust settles, that nCoV-2019 was not a novel event or a misfortune that befell us. It was — it is — part of a pattern of choices that we humans are making.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">David Quammen is an author and journalist whose books include “Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

By the time I got back to New York last Friday, it was front page news around the world, with more than 800 cases in China and 26 deaths; by Monday, the total was at least 80 deaths.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">My students and I had all arrived a few days after China had reported the first cases of pneumonia in Wuhan to the World Health Organization, and shut down <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">the seafood market</a> that was thought to have been the origin of the epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I was teaching students from a wide variety of countries, who were in China for their first time. When they first brought up the question of the virus in Wuhan, I have to admit that my reaction was basically to reassure them, in line with all the official reassurances, and then to ask how many of them had gotten their annual flu shots. Wuhan was more than 500 miles away, and none of them would be going there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus had been identified as a new coronavirus on the first day of our class. By the end of the first week, the first death was reported, followed by the first overseas case. So sometime in the second week, the students, who had presumably been hearing from their anxious faraway parents, started to ask whether there was anything here to worry about. I gave stock answers: the situation is being monitored, no one here has been anywhere near Wuhan — but then again, I acknowledged, you have to take it seriously; you never know what a virus is going to do.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s </em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">update on the coronavirus</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></strong>]</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a pediatrician who has done a fair amount of traveling and worked in clinics in the United States through a variety of outbreaks (H1N1, SARS, Ebola, measles), I made the usual suggestions, which people find so unsatisfying when they’re scared: Stay as healthy as you can, get lots of sleep, drink lots of water. Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. That will help keep you safe from all kinds of infections, I said, remembering that students often come down with the standard winter colds and other viral infections during the intense three weeks of the January term.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yes, I asked them how many had gotten the annual flu shots that I knew all student health services are anxious to give — and sure enough, many of them had not. So I allowed myself to give a pompous little lecture about all the thousands of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">people dying of influenza</a> — and the thousands more who will die before the flu season is over. Why didn’t <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">that</em> scare them, I wanted to know — at least enough to get their flu shots? Why were some cases of pneumonia in Wuhan — and some deaths, but fewer than 10 at that point — so much more terrifying?</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If I had held up a syringe full of some unknown mixture and announced that it was an untested compound that might protect against the Wuhan virus, would people have knocked one another over in the race to get injected?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Well, things moved fast, and they only got scarier. The students got updates from the university, and more worried messages from their parents, and the news out of Wuhan got worse. I had seen Wuhan as far away, but the parents, much farther away, saw it as very close — and in some ways, they were right. And cases were beginning to be reported from other countries in Asia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Halfway through the three-week course, I checked and confirmed that no human-to-human transmission had been reported at that point, and explained to the students why that was reassuring — but also, given the history of viruses that have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/china-virus.html" title="">jumped from animals to humans, like SARS</a>, why it needed to be monitored, and might change. And sure enough, at the beginning of the third and last week of classes, human-to-human transmission was confirmed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The students who did get sick with the usual January respiratory illnesses were frightened. They got checked out, they got treated, and they had to sit through another lecture from me about getting that flu shot — not because it would protect them against this new infection, but because anyone who came down with influenza would now be terrified it might be the new coronavirus. And because influenza is also a serious illness, and there will continue to be a lot of it around.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The day before the course ended, as everyone was packing up to leave, the city of Wuhan was closed to air travel and other forms of transport, essentially locked down. What had seemed kind of unimaginable a week before suddenly seemed very close. Was it possible the travel ban would extend to all of China? And was the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">Wuhan quarantine</a> an extreme measure, or was it too little too late?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The story was changing every day — new information, new anxieties. Chinese New Year celebrations were being scaled down or canceled in many parts of China. New cases were being reported from France, Canada, Australia, the United States. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/01/24/scientists-are-unraveling-chinese-coronavirus-with-unprecedented-speed-openness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Scientific inquiry was proceeding fast</a>, seemingly with good cooperation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We were all told to be sure to get to the airport four hours early, since there would be extra screening measures. In fact, since we were traveling on the eve of the lunar New Year, the airport was pretty empty when we got there, as were the roads on the way — the vacation had begun, no one was working, and most people had already done their traveling and were in place for the holiday. There was a sign at the airport informing us that we were walking through a temperature scanner, but the lines moved quickly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Everyone was wearing masks, from basic surgical masks, which were being handed out in hotels and offices, to much more elaborate closefitting masks with respirators in them. There are reports that the masks don’t help, but it’s probably fair to say that they decrease, but don’t eliminate, the chance of infection. And there was a very definite getting-out-of-Dodge feeling as we boarded the airplane (never mind that airplanes — with their recycled air — are actually very effective settings for the spread of respiratory infections) and took off. Some people took their masks off, others kept them on for the whole 14 hours. No one was coughing on the flight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When I left Shanghai on Friday, no deaths from the virus had been reported there. By Sunday, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/china-coronavirus.html" title="">the city’s first death had been reported</a>. On the way to the airport, I read the notice from the hospital in New York where I see pediatric patients, giving us the city guidelines for screening patients, checking travel histories, isolating people with fever and lower respiratory symptoms, along with a history of travel from Wuhan, or contact with a person who may have the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There was something ironic, of course, about the idea of coming back from China to what might be a higher exposure risk (lots of sick people in a hospital). Everyone who works in a health care setting has seen some version of this over and over (we still have the signs up about screening for Ebola). New viruses do appear, and you never know what a virus is going to do, but you have to take the information you have and do your best. (And at least, at the clinic, everyone gets a flu shot.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So there was also something very comforting in the matter-of-fact directions. And oddly, maybe especially in the very matter-of-fact statement, “Please note, all guidance is subject to change as additional information becomes available.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

They smashed their Molotov cocktails into the lobby of a public housing estate, and flames and smoke began spewing out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This was no scene from the protest violence last year over Beijing’s dominance of Hong Kong’s affairs. This was on Sunday, and the firebombing was incited by anger over the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China — and plans by the Hong Kong government to use the unoccupied housing block as a quarantine area.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Angst and anger fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 130 people on the mainland and has eight confirmed cases in Hong Kong, are compounding the bitterness from months of protests against Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s leadership. And it has set her government scrambling.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, she relented after days of heavy pressure to put harder limits on travel from the mainland to Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaking at a news conference with a mask over her face, she announced the shutdown of major rail passenger links and limits on flights for people coming from the mainland. The government in Beijing will also stop issuing visas for individual travelers to Hong Kong from the mainland. Those moves were unprecedented, Hong Kong researchers say, and were avoided even during the height of the SARS epidemic in 2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The prospect of a new avenue for criticism of Hong Kong’s government, after months of simmering conflict with protesters, has caused alarm among officials as they are trying to appear responsive to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More broadly, the concern over the outbreak is again bringing resentment of the mainland to the fore. As they did during the SARS crisis, which killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong, and then again during the protests against Beijing’s intervention in the Hong Kong territory’s limited autonomy, people here are expressing distrust over the Chinese leadership’s lack of transparency and arbitrary decision-making.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And for many, that distrust is extended to Mrs. Lam, Beijing’s handpicked chief executive, who will be under even heavier scrutiny as she tries to bring a divided city together to head off the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We learned the lesson from SARS,” said Wong Hoi-ying, a district council representative in Fanling, the location of a proposed quarantine site in northern Hong Kong. “We put on our masks even before the coronavirus was confirmed to have entered Hong Kong.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Wong said she was shocked to learn from a news conference on Saturday that the Hong Kong government had identified the unoccupied public housing complex, in Fanling, as a possible quarantine site for the relatives of infected people.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her constituents “were outraged,” she said. “It’s within 100 meters of residences nearby, there are at least two schools and a few more kindergartens in the vicinity. It’s not a suitable location for quarantine purposes.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within hours of the protest on Sunday, the authorities said they were delaying plans to use the public housing complex, while moving ahead with the use of remote, government-owned vacation bungalows. On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam said the government would abandon any plans to use the Fanling site.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The militancy of residents caught them by surprise,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He noted that the protesters included not only the contingent that has been rallying against the government for months, but also some people from the pro-establishment camp known as the blue ribbons.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They ostensibly support the government, but when it came to using their neighborhood for quarantine, they came out and blocked the roads,” Mr. Ma said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Late Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei, the province that includes Wuhan, or anyone who had traveled there in the past two weeks from entering Hong Kong. Just a day earlier Mrs. Lam had resisted calls for keeping out mainland visitors, saying it would be “inappropriate and impractical.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She faced expanded demands to restrict arrivals from the mainland. Some medical workers and epidemiologists, labor unions and even pro-Beijing politicians called for a more complete closure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, after a suspected explosive device was found in a trash can at a checkpoint at the mainland border, an anonymous message appeared on social media threatening a campaign to damage roads and railways connecting the city to mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If the Hong Kong Communists refuse to close (the border), we will do it for you,” the message said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her critics point out that Mrs. Lam did not act to stop entries from Hubei until Macau, the former Portuguese colony that like Hong Kong operates with some autonomy from the central government, did it first. Macau said Sunday that it would only allow residents from Hubei to enter if they provided documentation to show they were not infected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The heightened restrictions announced Tuesday might still not be enough, as several border crossings and the airport will remain open, Mr. Ma said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It shows she can respond to public opinion, but it might be too little too late,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many Hong Kong civil servants will work from home for the rest of the week. Officials called for private employers to permit similar working arrangements to keep people off the streets after the end of the Lunar New Year holiday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the criticism, in many ways, Hong Kong is the best-equipped Chinese city for dealing with an outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was one of the first places in China to begin reporting possible cases of infection from the coronavirus. And it has deep and painfully earned experience from the SARS outbreak, which killed at least eight health care workers. Some of the survivors still have lung damage 17 years later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Doctors and nurses in Hong Kong have drawn lots to determine when they would work in coronavirus isolation wards for six-week shifts, said Arisina Ma, the president of the Public Doctors’ Association. One hospital rearranged its cafeteria so that all tables faced the walls, a precaution from the SARS era to help prevent employees from infecting each other during their meals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health authorities were scrambling to find living quarters for health workers after they had completed duty inside isolation wards. Hotels were also unwilling to accept large numbers of medical workers for fear of public reaction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Ma suggested requiring visitors and residents who were returning from the mainland at the close of the Lunar New Year holiday to stay home for 14 days, the incubation period for the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once the community outbreak takes place, and we still let sick people from mainland to come in, I can definitely tell you our system cannot cope with all those sick patients,” she said. “We are waiting for the worst to come. Of course we will try to stop it, but I am not sure if our government is efficient and determined enough to stop the worst to come.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was unclear, though, whether the upwelling of anger here would give new momentum to a protest movement that in recent weeks had become notably less intense.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some protesters have called for rallies this week to raise both long-running demands, such as an investigation into police use of force and expanded direct elections, and new ones, such as further limiting mainland arrivals to prevent spread of the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But other activists have said the complaints about the government’s response to the outbreak are too local and focused on keeping quarantine sites out of neighborhoods to develop into a citywide movement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another factor might also keep people off the streets: fear of infection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It might make it almost impossible to have a large-scale gathering in Hong Kong,” Mr. Ma said. “Even the protesters might not suggest people come out.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Tiffany May, Elaine Yu and Ezra Cheung contributed reporting from Hong Kong.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Videos show patients in Wuhan beseeching medical staff for treatment. Residents of Wuhan and its province, Hubei, are being chased off planes and ousted from hotels and villages.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online critics are comparing current leaders unfavorably with past ones, even though the older generation had its own tarnished record on responding to emergencies. Some people have urged local party officials to kill themselves.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As cracks show in China’s veneer of stability, even some with ties to the party leadership are calling for those in power to shine light on divisions rather than papering them over. The crisis has shown that China remains riddled with vulnerabilities that no amount of censorship or strong-arming can hide.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The local government’s tolerance level of different online voices is way too low,” wrote Hu Xijin, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/world/asia/hu-xijin-global-times-us-china-tensions.html" title="">the editor of the Global Times newspaper</a>, a nationalist, party-controlled outlet that fiercely defends Beijing from its critics, in a social media post.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Government agencies have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/world/asia/china-journalists-crackdown.html" title="">weakened</a> the checks-and-balances function of the Chinese news media, Mr. Hu wrote, citing the example of eight early whistle-blowers who were summoned for talks by the Wuhan police.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=STYLN_wuhan_coronavirus_menu&amp;variant=1_wuhan_coronavirus_menu&amp;region=header&amp;context=menu#link-129cc5af" title="">coronavirus outbreak</a> has already killed over 100 people and infected more than 4,000 in China, mostly in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei. For online critics of the government’s responses, which at times have been slow or seemingly random, the crisis has prompted a rethinking of the grand trade-off with the party, in which the people have surrendered individual rights for the promise of stability and prosperity.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The current system looks so vibrant, yet it’s shattered completely by a governance crisis,” one user wrote on the social media site Weibo.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We gave up our rights in exchange for protection,” the user wrote. “But what kind of protection is it? Where will our long-lasting political apathy lead us?”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 5, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The post was shared over 7,000 times and liked 27,000 times before censors deleted it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Westerners can be easily awed by how quickly and forcefully the Chinese government can mobilize resources and build infrastructure. Even some international public health experts have said they were impressed with the speed and scale of China’s lockdown on more than a dozen cities, which has affected 56 million people. The Chinese propaganda machine has highlighted such abilities as two new Wuhan coronavirus hospitals are built from scratch, to be completed in days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This single-minded pursuit of efficiency masks deep problems. Propaganda videos and flashy new buildings don’t show the toll that this relentless drive can take on people, society or the environment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many Chinese people are willing to go along. Partly, the state has taught them to think that way. But many are satisfied with the status quo because they believe that the party has kept their interests in mind.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The epidemic now threatens to change some of that thinking.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials in Wuhan initially played down the threat and censored information as the disease spread throughout the country and even internationally. The city and the province then abruptly imposed a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">lockdown</a> on travel, even though millions had already left for China’s Lunar New Year holiday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Local residents complained that restrictions later imposed on traffic made it difficult for people to get to work and seek medical assistance, perhaps hindering prevention efforts rather than helping them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan’s medical system was so overwhelmed that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006936419/coronavirus-china-wuhan.html" title="">videos</a> of overworked medical workers having breakdowns and desperate patients pleading for help circulated widely online.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The situation was so dire that Zhang Ouya, a senior reporter at the state-run Hubei Daily, wrote that “Hubei must immediately replace its commanders” on his verified Weibo account. The post was soon deleted, but a screenshot circulated widely. In an official document leaked online, the newspaper apologized to Wuhan officials and promised that its staff would post only positive content.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many people in China, the most unexpected revelation came when local hospitals ran out of supplies and had to ask for donations on social media, going around the Chinese bureaucracy. As the crisis expanded, even hospitals in Beijing and other provinces resorted to public appeals for face masks and protective medical gowns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ve always thought we have the most refined state-run system, which can pool and deploy resources at a moment’s notice,” wrote a Weibo user called Meng Chang, a former journalist in Beijing. But the reality was disappointing, he wrote: “Where is the omnipotent system?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">National leaders, meanwhile, look out of touch. As the outbreak became a national crisis, the front page of the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, last week extolled the leadership but didn't mention Wuhan. “There’re no people in the People’s Daily,” one of my WeChat connections, an economist, messaged me.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China Central Television, the state broadcaster, featured a banquet held by the leadership to celebrate the country’s successes. On Friday night, the eve of the Lunar New Year, CCTV’s annual holiday broadcast worked in six minutes of praise for Wuhan’s medical workers between the skits and songs. Wuhan’s people went unmentioned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was very sad when watching the Spring Festival gala last night,” a woman named Jiujiu told the podcast <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/hk/podcast/%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B-fm/id1256399960?l=en&amp;i=1000463649899" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Gushi FM</a>. “Wuhan has come to this, yet the whole nation still seemed full of great joy.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some within China’s institutions appear to be trying to fix the problems.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Weibo has censored many posts about the epidemic, it appears to be leaving loopholes for its users to vent. Wang Gaofei, Weibo’s chief executive, posted <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/30716139#free-full-text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">research</a> by scientists at the University of Washington that showed a correlation between greater news coverage and a reduction in infections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in a country where history is often rewritten to serve the party’s interests, the lessons of the past can be forgotten. Discussion of SARS, the outbreak that killed hundreds 17 years ago, has been muted. Even as many Chinese people quietly complain about current leaders, they wax nostalgic about the role that former President Hu Jintao played in the SARS epidemic, apparently forgetting that Beijing tried to cover up that outbreak for three months.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A video of a CCTV interview with Beijing’s mayor at the time, Wang Qishan, who is now China’s vice president, was viewed over four million times in two hours before it was deleted. The comments were full of praises for his candid and confident answers and yearning for a strong leader like him.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s not that this nation has a bad memory,” wrote one person who pointed out the irony. “It’s because those in power don’t like that you remember.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The police in various parts of China have fined or detained over 40 people in the past few days for spreading “rumors,” many of which claimed that there were confirmed cases of the virus locally, according to a tally by a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3dYMFTlvXS-WuEJcZDytWw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">WeChat account</a> based on media reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wang Heyan, an investigative reporter for the magazine Caixin who has written about corruption cases involving top Chinese leaders, lamented on her WeChat timeline that she and her colleagues couldn’t get any medical workers to talk to them in Wuhan. Even after she promised them anonymity, Ms. Wang said, the workers feared reprisals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If all medical workers aren’t willing to take a little risk to speak the truth and the media can’t report the truth, in the end everyone, including the doctors, will be victims,” she wrote.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A reporter from Beijing News also complained on social media that even though he was in the epicenter of the epidemic, he couldn’t write a single word about what he had learned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many Chinese still have strong belief in the power of the central government. After Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on Monday, a week after the epidemic became a full-blown crisis, a retiree <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=STYLN_wuhan_coronavirus_menu&amp;variant=1_wuhan_coronavirus_menu&amp;region=header&amp;context=menu#link-15538d14" title="">told</a> my colleague Chris Buckley, “In China, if a leader visits, that shows that all the resources of the government can be mobilized.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Li Haipeng, a former journalist, predicted as early as last week that eventually the state would come to Wuhan’s rescue.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The state will be interpreted, proved and trusted as the only savior,” he wrote on Weibo. “All our stories are the same: They start with the failure of the state and end with its victory.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Experts warned that the actual number of cases could be significantly higher and growing quickly. The number of deaths attributed to the virus also continued to grow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html" title="">travel restrictions</a> put a deeper freeze on China’s contact with the world, cutting off business and tourism as China’s economy faces a potential slowdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With China’s Lunar New Year holiday nearing its end, companies ordered workers to stay home and avoid travel. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/coronavirus-china-economic-impact.html" title="">economic impact</a> of such measures pointed to a deeper political crisis, with many people accusing the Chinese authorities online of failing to act quickly to contain the virus, even as the government continues to struggle to control its spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The travel advisories and bans came as the virus showed early signs of spreading outside China, with cases of transmission to people who had not recently traveled to China reported in Japan, Germany and Vietnam. Countries across the world may now be faced with the task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not simply seeking to identify and quarantine infected people who had been in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0128-travelers-avoid-china.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">warned against nonessential travel to China</a>, noting that there is “limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.” The United States is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/airports-screening-coronavirus.html" title="">expanding the screening of travelers</a> arriving from Wuhan to 20 airports and other ports of entry, from five, federal officials said on Tuesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization revised its global risk assessment for the outbreak from “moderate” to “high,” although it noted this shift in a footnote buried in a report published on Monday. The change in the risk assessment, which coincided with a visit to China by the organization’s director general, risked confusing the public about the severity of the outbreak, which has killed more than 130 people in China and been diagnosed in at least 14 countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization was criticized after it refused twice in recent days to declare the outbreak a global emergency, despite its spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With other countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the locked-down epicenter of the outbreak in central China, the WHO said its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had discussed with Chinese officials “possible alternatives to evacuation of foreigners if there are ways to accommodate them and protect their health.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know?

The Chinese authorities agreed on Tuesday to<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/airports-screening-coronavirus.html" title=""> allow in teams of international experts</a>, coordinated by the World Health Organization, to help with research and containment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese officials said Wednesday that 132 people had died from the virus, up from 106 the day before. The total number of confirmed cases rose sharply as well, to 5,974 on Wednesday, according to the National Health Commission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The youngest confirmed patient is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. While the majority of confirmed cases were in Hubei, where a number of cities have been put under effective lockdown, an additional 1,800 cases have been diagnosed outside the province, the authorities said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan, medical workers have cited a lack of masks and kits to test for the virus. China’s medical products administration said on Sunday it had approved new virus detection kits to speed detection, but three Chinese medical companies said they did not have the capacity to produce enough of them, according to local news media reports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many in Wuhan with symptoms of the virus <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/27china-coronavirus-health.html" title="">have not been tested</a> or have been told the hospitals did not have enough test kits, some local residents said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During a visit to Wuhan on Monday, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, promised to provide more equipment, and the local government has begun building new hospitals that it hopes to open in a matter of weeks. But online, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html" title="">many people mocked</a> the government’s efforts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In indications of the virus’s spread beyond China’s borders, Thailand reported 14 cases of infection, while the United States and Australia have each confirmed five cases. Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia each said they had confirmed four cases.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which has now confirmed six cases, said that the virus had been found in the first Japanese citizen. The ministry said he had worked as a bus driver for two different tour groups from Wuhan. He had no history of traveling to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man, who had driven for the tours earlier this month, first reported experiencing chills, a cough and joint pain on Jan. 14. He visited a clinic three days later, but was sent home. On Jan. 22, his joint pain and cough grew worse, and he returned to a health clinic on Saturday, when a chest X-ray showed abnormalities and he was admitted to a hospital. A test confirmed the coronavirus on Tuesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">German officials said Tuesday that they had identified what they believed was the first instance of the virus spreading within Europe. They said a man from Starnberg in Bavaria was infected and was being treated and kept in isolation. The health ministry described him as being in “good condition” medically and said it was also monitoring his family and other people who might have been exposed, including in his children’s day care center.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was to be expected that the virus would come to Germany,” Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. “But the Bavarian case shows us that we are well prepared.” He said the risk to Germans remained low.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan planned to send a chartered plane to Wuhan on Tuesday night to bring back the first Japanese citizens who wish to be repatriated. At least 13 countries have said they would evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have been transmitted from animals to humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Businesses that operate in China have issued warnings of their own. In a flurry of emails sent in recent days, General Motors, Honeywell, Bloomberg, Facebook and other companies have warned employees not to travel within mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Honeywell, which has offices and operations across China, said it had restricted travel to some regions, but did not specify which ones. A spokesman for General Motors said the company had issued a global travel ban to China, with only “business-critical” travel allowed and only after clearance from a doctor. Bloomberg told its employees in Hong Kong and mainland China to work remotely until further notice and it restricted travel to China and Hong Kong over the next 30 days, according to an email seen by The New York Times.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has extended the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 3, with some of China’s biggest cities telling businesses not to open until the following week. China’s biggest technology companies went further, notifying employees to work from home until Feb. 10. NetEase, an internet and entertainment platform, asked employees who were returning from another city to quarantine themselves for 14 days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Investors in Asia were gripped on Tuesday with fear about the health of the global economy for a second day, with a widespread sell-off continuing in the markets. Investors dumped stocks in companies thought to be most vulnerable to the effects of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The coronavirus is the No. 1 threat to financial markets currently as global investors are becoming jittery on the uncertainty,” said Nigel Green, founder of an investment company, the deVere Group.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Hong Kong, medical professionals called for additional border checkpoints.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The next week or two will be a critical time for the development of the epidemic,” the faculty at the Chinese University of Hong Kong wrote on its Facebook page. “We must closely monitor whether there is a community outbreak outside Hubei Province, especially in Hong Kong’s neighboring regions.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Reporting was contributed by Chris Buckley, Russell Goldman, Elaine Yu, Raymond Zhong, Austin Ramzy, Sui-Lee Wee, Alexandra Stevenson, Eimi Yamamitsu, Tiffany May, Joseph Goldstein, Jeffrey E.

It turns out that they may have an immune system that lets them coexist with many disease-causing viruses.</p>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <a class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/james-gorman"><span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">James Gorman</span></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If previous outbreaks of coronavirus are any indication, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">the Wuhan strain that is now spreading</a> may eventually be traced back to bats.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has been working in China for 15 years studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said, “We don’t know the source yet, but there’s pretty strong evidence that this is a bat origin coronavirus.” He said, “It’s probably going to be the Chinese horseshoe bat,” a common species that weighs up to an ounce.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If he’s right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. SARS and MERS epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One bat can host many different viruses without getting sick. They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities. They are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. They are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats’ evolutionary adaptations to flight changed their immune systems.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(18)30041-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">2018 paper in Cell Host and Microbe</a>, scientists in China and Singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called DNA sensing. The energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of DNA that are then floating around where they shouldn’t be. Mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of DNA, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism. But in bats, they found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. They have a weakened response but it is still there. Thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a “balanced state of ‘effective response’ but not ‘over response’ against viruses.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">How to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as 2019-nCoV, is, of course, of paramount importance now. But tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. “The outbreak can be contained and controlled,” Dr. Daszak said. “But if we don’t know the origin in the long term then this virus can continue to spill over.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists in China were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last spring, in an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/3/210" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">article on bat coronaviruses,</a> or CoVs, a group of Chinese researchers wrote that “it is generally believed that batborne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.” They added, “In this regard, China is a likely hot spot.” This wasn’t clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Certainly, rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can jump and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. But there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They are numerous and widespread. While bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50 percent, and then there’s the rest of us. Bats live on every continent except Antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. The ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their feces can spread disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People in many parts of the world eat bats, and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of SARS, and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan. They also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a 2017 report in Nature, Dr. Daszak, Kevin J. Olival and other colleagues from EcoHealth Alliance, reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analyzed which viruses were harbored by which mammals and how they affected their hosts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They confirmed what scientists had thought: “Bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.” Zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And they don’t just survive the viruses they harbor. Bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. The big brown bat, a common species in the United States, can live nearly 20 years in the wild. Others live closer to 40. One <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.batcon.org/resources/media-education/bats-magazine/bat_article/152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tiny bat in Siberia lived at least 41 years</a>. Animals like house mice live about two years on average.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbor monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-china.html" title="">As others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa.</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. But since such outbreaks are inevitable, Dr. Daszak says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important. He compared the situation to terrorism. Both terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks seem inevitable. To get a jump on them, he said, intelligence is vital.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Starbucks said it has already closed more than half of its stores in China due to coronavirus. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China's 4,292 Starbucks stores brought in 10% of the company's revenue during the October-December period, so the closure will affect earnings, the company said. But it's not yet clear how much of an impact there will be. Starbucks had expected full-year revenue growth in the 6% to 8% range and same-store sales growth of 3% to 4%.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We remain optimistic and committed to the long term growth potential in China," Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson said in a conference call Tuesday with analysts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks shares fell 1.6% to $87.20 in extended trading following the earnings report.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Johnson said the holiday season was one of the best in the company's history. New drinks like the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew were a hit with customers. Starbucks' new four-story Reserve Roastery in Chicago — which opened in November — is serving an average of 10,000 visitors each day, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A combination of new stores and solid foot traffic helped the Seattle-based coffee giant handily beat Wall Street's forecasts in the October-December period. The company opened 539 net new stores in its fiscal first quarter. It now has nearly 32,000 stores worldwide. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks' earnings rose 16% to $886 million in the fiscal first quarter. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring items like restructuring charges, were 79 cents per share. That beat Wall Street's forecast of 76 cents. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks said same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least 13 months — jumped 5% worldwide in the October-December period, ahead of analysts' forecast of 4.4%. Revenue was up 7% to $7.1 billion, in line with analysts' forecasts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said she's confident the company can sustain that momentum because of new products and technology in the pipeline. Starbucks is adding new equipment to stores to improve its cold brew process, she said. The company also plans to introduce a plant-based sausage sandwich at breakfast and more non-dairy milks based on customer requests, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks also plans more mobile order and pickup locations in the U.S. after the successful opening of a small-format store in New York during the quarter. Mobile ordering and payment represented 17% of U.S. sales in the first quarter.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

A Trump administration official said the U.S. was “disappointed.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The decision did not name Huawei, specifying instead that “high-risk vendors” posing “greater security and resilience risks to U.K. telecoms networks” would be able to provide equipment in some portions of the network, like antennas and base stations, but not parts of the nerve center like servers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Implications: </strong>Britain’s membership in the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group, along with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S., gives the decision added significance.

In China, he routinely had the highest sales of shoes and jerseys.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bryant was a frequent visitor to China for basketball camps and promotional stops, and he appeared in commercials, like one with the Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou. He was also popular in the Philippines.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The investigation: </strong>All possible causes for the helicopter crash on Sunday that killed Bryant and eight others are still being considered, but the hillsides around the flight’s destination near Los Angeles were enveloped in a nearly blinding fog at the time. The helicopter was not carrying a cockpit voice recorder, and federal investigators aren’t expected to reach a conclusion for months. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/kobe-bryant-death.html" title="">Here are the latest updates</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Another angle:</strong> We <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/kobe-bryant-lower-merion-jeanne-mastriano.html" title="">spoke to a high school teacher</a> that Bryant considered a mentor and “muse” about their remarkable friendship: “He has left such a void behind,” she said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-44086aff">Long awaited, Trump peace plan favors Israel</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">President Trump unveiled his Middle East peace plan on Tuesday in the presence of only one party to the conflict, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What Mr. Trump called a “win-win” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html" title="">proposal would give Israel most of what it has sought</a> and create a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty. The Palestinian leadership immediately rejected the plan, which discards the idea of a full-fledged Palestinian state.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts saw the document as a distraction offered by a president under impeachment working with a prime minister under criminal indictment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The details:</strong> The plan would guarantee Israeli control of a unified Jerusalem as its capital and not require it to uproot any West Bank settlements. Mr. Trump promised to provide $50 billion in international financing for the new Palestinian entity and to open an embassy there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">At the impeachment trial:</strong> The president’s legal team made <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-28" title="">its last oral arguments</a> on Tuesday.

I had to cross one of the big bridges across the Yangtze for my reporting. And there I was, on one of these Chinese share bikes that are everywhere, on an almost completely empty bridge, spanning one of China’s biggest cities, crossing its biggest river. And there were just two other people on the bridge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A lot of people wonder how long the shutdown can last. Even now people are worrying about the jobs they may lose, the businesses that will close, the school semesters that they might miss.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">You’ve reported that </strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus-social-media.html" title="">the anger on Chinese social media</a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> is intense.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, and you hear that here as well. People erupt with a kind of anger and exasperation over how it was that this dangerous pathogen was among them but they didn’t understand, in many cases, how serious it was or what was going on until the city was shut down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But that’s leavened by a sense among many people that the most pressing thing is to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ChuBailiang/status/1222050019835969536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">get through this crisis </a>— so that as few people die as possible and life can return to a kind of normality as soon as possible.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What else are you seeing there?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You see a combination of reactions when you approach people to talk. First of all, there’s a natural wariness about getting close to anybody. But once you reassure them — you’re outside, at a distance of a good 10 feet — they can be very open and also very generous.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">How does that compare to the response you normally get?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reaction you get as a foreign reporter varies quite a bit across China.

But Switzerland is not a member of the EU, so it is not part of the EWRS. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the coronavirus's emergence, Bern has sought temporary access to the system and expects Brussels eventually to agree to its request, as it did during a recent Ebola outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But permanent access to the EWRS is hindered by an impasse in protracted talks with the EU because of disagreement over a treaty that foresees Switzerland routinely adopting single-market rules, among other things, to preserve favoured-trading status.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The situation could serve as a warning to Britain as it prepares to leave the EU while keeping trade ties to the bloc.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It's very difficult for us to know exactly what is going on in our neighbouring countries, especially which measures they are taking," Daniel Koch, head of the communicable diseases unit at the Swiss Federal Department of Health, told Reuters. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"What it shows now is that when a crisis starts, it's a little bit late to put us in, it takes too much time."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Switzerland has no confirmed cases of the respiratory illness that emerged weeks ago in Wuhan in China. But the confirmation of cases in France and Germany has made Swiss health officials anxious to get news of developments fast.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The Europeans have expanded their early warning system," Koch said. "They communicate with each other. And it's not that they don't want to communicate with us. But it doesn't occur to them that we don't see the reports." </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">DIGITAL PLATFORM</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The EWRS is a digital platform linking the EU's executive European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and health authorities across the EU to manage serious cross-border threats.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A deal giving Switzerland access is ready for signature as part of a broader health pact with the EU.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But talks are blocked by the EU's demand over single-market rules and a request by Brussels for Bern to create a more effective platform for resolving disputes. Talks are on hold until May, when Swiss voters decide whether to cancel an EU free-movement accord.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond excluding the Swiss from the early-alert system, other consequences of the EU impasse include suspension of cross-border securities trading in July.

The Chinese New Year usually brings in plenty of travelers and delivers profits of around $3,000 a month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the place is empty. Wuhan, the center of a deadly viral outbreak, is on lockdown. “There is not a single customer,’’ said the hotel’s owner, who gave only his surname, Cui. He still has to pay rent and his utility bills. Instead of counting his earnings, he’s expecting to lose $1,500 a month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak arrives at a bad time for Wuhan, China and the world economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China, with the world’s No. 2 economy, was decelerating even before the coronavirus hit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the world economy is coping with an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in No. 7 India, which prompted the International Monetary Fund last week to downgrade its outlook for global growth this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The coronavirus is drawing comparisons to the SARS outbreak, which paralyzed the economies of China and Hong Kong for weeks in 2003. But what happens in China carries a lot more weight these days: In 2003, China accounted for 4% of global output. Now its share is 16%, according to the World Bank.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“A growth slowdown in China could have sizable ripple effects across Asia and the rest of the world, given the size of China’s economy and its role as the key driver of global growth in recent years,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist and former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No one knows exactly how the outbreak will play out or what its economic impact will be. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Authorities are still trying to better understand the new virus. It is from the coronavirus family, which also can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, China has confirmed more than 4,500 coronavirus cases and more than 100 deaths. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has locked down Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province, isolating more than 50 million people. The United States and other countries prepared Tuesday to airlift their citizens out of Wuhan. The outbreak has brought every day business to a standstill and closed down such popular tourist attractions as Beijing's former imperial palace, Shanghai Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland and the city's Ocean Park.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The significant decline in travel has already caused United Airlines to suspend some flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai, the airline said in a statement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s still too soon to measure what the impact is going to be from an economic perspective,’’ said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SARS experience offers some reason for economic optimism. That outbreak, centered in southern China, initially clobbered the Chinese economy. In the April-June quarter of 2003, China’s economic growth dropped to an annual rate of 9.1% from 11.1% the previous quarter, noted economists Tommy Wu and Priyanka Kishore of Oxford Economics. But as the health crisis subsided, growth picked back up, recovering to a 10% annual rate in the second half of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“From what we know, it’s likely to be similar this time,’’ said Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia. “People shouldn’t get panicked that growth is going to slow sharply’’ over a sustained period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the Chinese economy isn’t the dynamo it was in the early and mid-2000s when growth routinely hit double digits.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The IMF expects China’s growth to drop from 6.1% in 2019, already the slowest since 1990, to 6% this year and 5.8% next. The slowdown reflects China’s difficult transition from fast but unsustainable growth built around often-wasteful investments to steadier but less striking growth built on consumer spending by the country’s growing middle class.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the United States. The two countries signed a truce earlier this month that was expected to provide some economic relief. Then the viral outbreak hit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As part of the so-called Phase 1 deal, China agreed to increase purchases of U.S. products by $200 billion over this year and next. That goal sounded ambitious even before the viral outbreak isolated tens of millions of Chinese consumers and delivered a wallop to consumer and business confidence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rothman suspects the United States might give the Chinese a little leeway. “Both governments really want the deal to work,’’ he said. “Ïf it is clear that (Chinese purchases) are off to a slow start not because the Chinese government is not trying its best but because of the virus, the Trump administration is likely to be sympathetic.’’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There has been no immediate impact on China’s vast manufacturing industries because factories already were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday and weren’t due to reopen until this week or later. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think the first quarter looks like it will take quite a significant hit,” said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Markit. “This still is escalating, so it’s hard to talk about when this will be contained.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> Further delays in restarting production could send shock waves through Asian suppliers of components and exporters of iron ore, copper and other commodities as far away as Australia, Brazil and Africa.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> Foreign suppliers usually see a surge in Chinese orders as factories restock after shutting down for 10 days or more during the holiday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “The loss of economic output could be quite substantial, and that has consequences for the Asian manufacturing supply chain, because orders won’t come in the way people expect,” Biswas said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The impact in other developing Asian countries might reduce their 2020 economic growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points, according to a forecast by Edward Glossop of Capital Economics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Growth in Asian emerging markets “will slow sharply in the first quarter of the year,” Glossop said in a report.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters Tuesday that Japanese exports, production and corporate profits could be pinched by the new virus, stressing that he was closely monitoring the situation. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A more direct hit is already coming from the decline in tourist traffic from China. Nishimura said Chinese travelers usually account for about a third of tourists from abroad. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese tourists to Japan tend to be relatively big spenders. The virus has hit right at the time when Chinese travel for the lunar new year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan’s economy suffered from the SARS outbreak in 2003, but the damage was limited to several months. The big difference is that Japan has far more Chinese tourists these days. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now “the impact on the Japanese economy would be far greater,” said Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, while adding that much depends on how widespread the outbreak proves to be.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is hardly anything good that can be hoped for economically because of the new virus,” he said. Increased sales of masks and other protective gear, he noted, will hardly pick up the slack.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wiseman reported from Washington, McDonald from Beijing and Kageyama from Tokyo.

The agency has faced stiff budget cuts under President Donald Trump, including to emergency funds and global health programs that were established following West Africa's Ebola epidemic in 2014. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Like so much else, Trump’s approach to keeping us safe from disease outbreaks is a mess,” Warren wrote in an online post announcing the plan. “But when he’s gone, we can fix it.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Warren's proposal comes as the coronavirus has killed more than 100 people in China and the city at the center of the crisis, Wuhan, remains on lockdown. The U.S. has confirmed cases in Washington state, Illinois, Southern California and Arizona.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The timing of Warren's announcement was no accident — nor is the fact that she's the candidate drawing up the proposal. During more than a year of campaigning, Warren has embraced the reputation of having “a plan” for nearly everything. She remains bunched near the top of the polls with former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigeig, with the Iowa caucuses, which lead off primary voting, looming on Feb. 3. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Warren blamed the Trump administration for proposing “billions in cuts to the agencies responsible for fighting and preventing pandemics, a devastating blow that would put lives at risk." Not all of those reductions have been approved by Congress, though. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She also promised to push the CDC to develop vaccines against infectious diseases, including a universal immunization against the flu. But it is the National Institutes of Health that has already made a priority of developing a better flu vaccine. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Warren said she can mitigate the spread of disease by fighting climate change and moving the U.S. to a universal, government-funded health system under the “Medicare for All” program. She also wants to increase NIH funding by $100 billion. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although such a high price tag may make it difficult to survive the appropriations process, Warren plans to help with the funding by creating a “swear jar." That would be a pot of money requiring private companies to pay some of their profits from publicly funded research back to the NIH. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Warren further promises to work with Congress to replenish funding for the Department of Health and Human Services' Public Health Emergency Fund to better respond to outbreaks and to create a Global Health Security Corps that will “ensure that we can get the right expertise to the center of an outbreak before it becomes an epidemic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Diseases like coronavirus remind us why we need robust international institutions, strong investments in public health, and a government that is prepared to jump into action at a moment's notice,” Warren wrote. “When we prepare and effectively collaborate to address common threats that don’t stop at borders, the international community can stop these diseases in their tracks.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Another three cases were confirmed later Tuesday, all connected to the first.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 33-year-old man from the Starnberg area south of Munich was in isolation at a Munich hospital as a precaution, officials in Bavaria said. However, they stressed that his condition is good.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man took part last Tuesday in a training session at his workplace that also included an employee of the same company visiting from China, said Andreas Zapf, the head of Bavaria's office for health and food safety.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman, who hadn't previously shown any symptoms, flew home on Thursday and went to a doctor after feeling ill on the flight, Zapf said. She then tested positive for the new virus. The woman lives in Shanghai, but had been visited a few days earlier by her parents, who come from the worst-affected Wuhan area.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, the German company was informed of the positive test, and it notified authorities and employees. An employee who had been at the training session came forward and said he had experienced bronchitis-like symptoms over the weekend, though they had receded and he came to work on Monday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Authorities decided when they received positive test results Monday evening to admit him to a hospital and put him in isolation for monitoring.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Auto parts supplier Webasto confirmed that it was the company involved and that the man works at its headquarters in Stockdorf, south of Munich. It canceled all travel to and from China for the next two weeks and said employees at Stockdorf are free to work from home this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later Tuesday, Bavaria's state health ministry said another three cases of the virus had been confirmed and all were employees of the same company, news agency dpa reported.

That suggests consumer spending could stay fairly strong in the near term and blunt some of the hit on the economy from weak business investment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Business spending has remained weak even as the Federal Reserve cut interest rate cuts three times last year. Officials from the U.S. central bank started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. They are expected to reiterate the Fed's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Weak business investment and the resulting slump in manufacturing have been on the radar of Fed officials who have blamed trade tensions, especially the White House's 18-month trade war with China, and an uncertain global economic growth outlook for the malaise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though tensions have eased with the signing this month of a "Phase 1" trade deal between Washington and Beijing, Boeing continues to loom over manufacturing. Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Manufacturing is clearly losing momentum as many of the most extreme tariffs on supply-chain inputs factories need to produce their final goods remain in place," said Chris Rupkeychief economist at MUFG in New York. "When it comes to forecasting the economy in 2020, it's the consumer stupid."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.9% last month as demand for machinery, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components declined. That was the largest decrease since April.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Data for November was revised lower to show these so-called core capital goods orders edging up 0.1% instead of gaining 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods would be unchanged in December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Core capital goods orders rose 0.8% in 2019. Shipments of core capital goods decreased 0.4% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They declined by an unrevised 0.3% in November.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Business investment has contracted for two straight quarters and was likely stuck in the red in the fourth quarter. The latest data also suggest a recovery is unlikely soon.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 3.4 points to a reading of 131.6 in January, the highest reading since August. Economists expected a temporary drop in consumer confidence in February because of the deadly coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people in China, with cases reported in some countries including the United States, France and Japan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 37.4 this month from 33.5 in December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. Though the labor market remains strong, there are signs that momentum is slowing. Job growth cooled in December and vacancies recorded their biggest drop in more than four years in November.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The good news is that a drop in confidence is unlikely by itself to cause a significant drop in consumer spending," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies as concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak boosted demand for safe-haven currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">MANUFACTURING SLUMP</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S.-China trade war has hurt business confidence, undercutting capital expenditure and pushing manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, into recession. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is expected to wreak havoc with the supply chain. The plane maker's largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, announced early this month that it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists estimate the production suspension could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. The hit to GDP growth would come from a smaller inventory build. Though airlines have continued to submit orders there have been no deliveries, leading to a rise in inventories at factories. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In December, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rebounded 2.4% after tumbling 3.1% in the prior month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They were boosted by a 7.6% surge in orders for transportation equipment, the largest increase since August 2018, which followed an 8.3% drop in November. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Orders for defense aircraft and parts soared 168.3% last month, offsetting a 74.7% plunge in demand for civilian aircraft. Boeing reported on its website that it had received only three commercial aircraft orders in December, down from 63 in November. December is normally a strong month for aircraft orders. Motor vehicles and parts orders fell 0.9% in December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Business spending is set to remain weak in the coming quarters," said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

On Monday it hit a three-month low of $58.50, as the virus outbreak triggered a global selloff of riskier assets. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de-facto leader, joined by key oil producers such as the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Oman, sought to calm market jitters on Monday - urging caution against gloomy expectations on the impact of the virus on the global economy and oil demand.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But OPEC officials have also started weighing their options and intensified internal discussion on how best to respond to the price slump, the sources said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"A further extension is a strong possibility and a deeper cut is a possibility," said one OPEC source, adding that the impact of the China virus on oil demand would be clearer over the coming week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Extension is highly possible ... until June," another source said, adding that an additional preferable option is to extend the pact until end of 2020 and that a deeper cut was "possible" if there was a need for it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A source familiar with Russian thinking, said that although Moscow had been keen earlier to exit from cuts, it would stay on board if oil prices continued to trade below $60 a barrel</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">OPEC+, which includes Russia, has been reducing oil supply to support prices, agreeing in December to hold back 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of output until the end of March.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russia had insisted it wanted the current deal to last only until March, while Saudi Arabia has been keener for the deal to last longer, according to OPEC+ sources.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year, OPEC expects its world market share to fall further as output booms in non-OPEC rivals including the United States, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Norway and Guyana while global demand is rising.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Saudi Arabia's economy, the largest in the Arab world, remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite plans to diversify.

A survey by the association of purchasing managers found that companies are uncertain about trade and are seeing weak demand from abroad.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The manufacturing sector last year was rocked by slower global growth and the escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China. President Donald Trump signed an initial agreement with China this month that may ease some of the drag caused by tariffs and threats of additional import taxes. However, the spread of a new virus in China threatens to hammer the nation's economy, and possibly others. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">3M, a component in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is also wrestling with the environmental clean-up associated with some of its products, including PFAS. Those chemicals are used in firefighting foam, nonstick pots and pans, water-repellent clothing and many other household and personal items. They are nicknamed "forever chemicals" because they persist in the environment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Studies have associated certain PFAS chemicals with increased risk of cancer and damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">3M booked a pre-tax charge of $214 million in the fourth quarter related to those environmental efforts. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> 3M Inc., which is based in St. Paul, Minnesota, earned $969 million, or $1.66 per share, in the fourth quarter. Its adjusted profit was $1.95 per share, far from the per-share earnings of $2.10 that industry analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research expected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Revenue totaled $8.11 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">3M also makes virus masks and in response to the spreading coronavirus in China, which has now killed at least 106 people, 3M is rapidly increasing production. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. government chartered a plane to fly out diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, and other Americans. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We're seeing increased demand for our respiratory protection products and we're ramping up our production worldwide in China, around the world, to meet that demand, Roman said. "At the same time, we're seeing what everybody else is seeing, that there's -- businesses are shutting down, extending their shutdown beyond Lunar New Year so we're really watching day-to-day what that's going to mean for our outlook for China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares of 3M, which have fallen 14% over the past year, ended Tuesday down $10.05, or 5.7%, at $165.58.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">_____</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Portions of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.5% at 7,447. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">U.S. shares appeared set to open higher with Dow futures gaining 0.5% and S&amp;P 500 futures rising 0.7%. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In China, the government said more than 4,500 people have been confirmed ill with the virus and 106 have died in the outbreak of a novel coronavirus centered on the city of Wuhan, an industrial hub along the Yangtze river. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The illness can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms, and Chinese authorities have extended the Lunar New Year holiday and ordered Wuhan and some other cities nearby to stop public transport and try to prevent people from traveling to help contain its spread. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus has spread to a dozen countries, including the U.S. Besides the threat to people's lives and health, investors are worried about how much damage the virus will do to profits for companies around the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even if they're thousands of miles away from Wuhan, foreign companies have plenty of customers and suppliers in China, the world's second-largest economy. Investors have been rattled by the potential for a wider impact from the outbreak. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“How long and how deep the correction lower will last, depends both on the success of China's efforts to control the viral spread, and the prevalence of its occurrence internationally," Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China were closed Tuesday for Lunar New Year holidays, while South Korea's benchmark tumbled 3.1% to 2,176.72 as it reopened after its own holidays. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.6% to 23,215.71, while Australia's S&amp;P ASX/200 slipped 1.4% to 6,994.50. India's Sensex lost 0.5% to 40,966.86. Singapore's benchmark dropped 1.7%, Jakarta's fell 0.5% and Thailand's erased earlier losses to fall 0.7%. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Overnight, a sell-off on Wall Street gave the Dow its first 5-day losing streak since early August and handed the S&amp;P 500 its worst day since early October.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Investors are also dealing with a heavy week of corporate earnings. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer reported a loss, though revenue figures were better than expected. Apple will report financial results later Tuesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Boeing, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Amazon are also among some of the biggest names reporting earnings throughout the week that includes 147 S&amp;P 500 companies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil rose 30 cents to $53.44 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Excess supply is due to total 562,000 tonnes in 2021. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We expect that aluminium demand will not significantly improve this year. As a consequence, the global market will probably record a surplus in 2020 and LME prices will decline over the year," said analyst Daniela Corsini from Intesa Sanpaolo bank in Milan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts expect cash LME aluminium to average $1,776 a tonne in 2020, up 1% from Monday's closing price.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">RAMPING UP ZINC OUTPUT </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rising supply is also expected to have an impact on the zinc market as mines ramp up production.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A surplus of 108,000 tonnes is forecast for this year, rising to 185,000 tonnes in 2021.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Ample availability of concentrate is expected to boost global refined zinc production in 2020 by nearly 3%," said Sanjeeban Sarkar, commodities editor at The Economist Intelligence Unit. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"As the market reaches a new equilibrium, we expect prices to fall."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts see the average cash LME zinc price at $2,295 a tonne, up 1.9% from the latest price.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Eric Onstad and Brijesh Patel; Additional reporting by Arpan Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Jan Harvey)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

People already believe China's economy will slow down, so there will be more upside for these bonds. I need to wait until China’s markets re-open," said Toshinobu Chiba, chief portfolio manager in the fixed income department at Nissay Asset Management Corp in Tokyo.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chiba is therefore using the forward curve in the offshore Chinese yuan &lt;CNH=D3&gt; to express his views, while also buying shorter term U.S. Treasury bonds and swapping his lower quality corporate bonds for higher.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Normally, in a situation like this, people would want to be long in countries with current account surpluses, like South Korea, Singapore or Taiwan, but you cannot because of their correlation with China," he said, adding that was why he was avoiding the Korean won.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stock markets in Thailand and Korea have fallen more than 2% in the past week, taking a bigger hit than U.S. and world stocks broadly. A large China ETF - iShares Large-Cap ETF sank nearly 4% on Monday and is now down about 10% since Jan. 17.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The baht &lt;THB=&gt; is Asia's worst performer for the year, with losses against the dollar nearly 3%.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">STRETCHED STOCK VALUATIONS</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts at JPMorgan recommended clients use currency options to hedge cheaply, given how low the measures of expected volatility were. To brace for a negative impact on the tourism sectors in Malaysia and Thailand, JPMorgan said it is changing to neutral an underweight holding in Thai government bonds and an overweight position in Malaysia's ringgit &lt;MYR=&gt;.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That demand for cheap hedges has seen implied volatility &lt;CNHVOL&gt; on offshore yuan rise by about a percentage point across tenors in the past week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chris Rands, Sydney-based portfolio manager for Nikko Asset Management, is tracking the spreads on credit default swaps, which are insurance products used to hedge against default risk, between those on Australia and the United States as one barometer of negative sentiment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He hasn't put on a trade yet, though, and many other big fund managers said they are sitting tight. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We don't have enough information to know how bad this is so we don't think we should be making huge decisions on the back of that," said Rands.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The panic engulfing markets and the resulting dive in bond yields could help underpin equity valuations, at least in the major developed nations, leaving emerging markets to bear the brunt.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Optimists argue that this episode would not be a repeat of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in part because Beijing had acted more quickly and radically this time.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the SARS outbreak initially caused steep losses for Asian stocks, they rebounded smartly in its wake.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One hurdle this time is that many equity markets globally are trading at stratospheric valuations.

Fueling its stellar run has been Chief Executive Tim Cook's push to turn Apple's loyal client base into a source of steady services revenue, including streaming video and a credit card launched last year with Goldman Sachs. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also supporting Apple's stock is excitement around an eventual pickup in iPhone demand with the rollout of 5G wireless technology, and low interest rates that have broadly helped Wall Street.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares of Apple fell 2.9% on Monday from record highs as fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China hit Wall Street. Analysts on Apple's quarterly earnings call after the bell on Tuesday will listen for comments concerning the impact on its manufacturing operations in China.Apple's market capitalization briefly exceeded $1.4 trillion last Wednesday for the first time, but it has yet to end a session at that level. Some investors worry that Apple's rally, and surging earnings multiple, may have become overextended. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The run-up in the stock is a concern, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit of a pullback in the near future," said People's United Advisors chief equity strategist John Conlon, who added that Apple's services business has become his main reason for owning stock.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Following its recent rally, Apple's stock is trading at the equivalent of 23 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2010, according to Refinitiv. Apple's average PE over the past decade was about 14, lagging other high-growth companies with recurring revenue and reflecting its singular dependence on iPhones sales and reliance on persuading consumers to upgrade their phones year after year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Salesforce.com and Netflix, which rely on recurring revenue, are trading at over 55 times expected earnings. Tech hardware sellers Intel and Cisco Systems are at about 14 times expected earnings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple is on track to reach a goal to double its 2016 services revenue to $48.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 as it focuses on selling high-margin subscriptions to its user base. Many investors envision an increasingly rosy future for its earnings, a trend reflected in its soaring earnings multiple.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Adding to existing services including cloud storage, the App Store and music, Apple last year launched an ambitious video streaming service, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple has also increased the emphasis on its AppleCare, its extended warranty program. For example, the iPhone's "settings" now includes reminders encouraging people to buy or renew their AppleCare plans. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the September quarter, Apple said its services revenue hit $12.51 billion, topping analysts expectations of $12.15 billion. Services accounted for 20% of total revenue in that quarter, up from 17% in the same quarter the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple also gave cost of sales data showing gross margins for its services segment rose to 64% from a 61% a year earlier. That is far more generous than Apple's overall gross margin of around 38% in recent years.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, for a business segment getting the most attention from Wall Street, Apple provides limited details. Apple's quarterly reports break out sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads, but a breakdown of results from products falling within the services category so far has not been released. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple's recent strong stock performance has been perpetuated by fund managers buying its shares in order to avoid underperforming their benchmarks, a trend that could reverse when the recent rally ends, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a client note last week. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, analysts on average expect services revenue to jump 19.7% to $13.0 billion, according to Refinitiv.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Overall quarterly revenue is expected to rise 5.0% to $88.5 billion, with adjusted net income inching up 1.5% to $20.3 billion and earnings per share of $4.55.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Noel Randewich, additional reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Tom Brown)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The company said customers spent heavily on its latest models, increasing iPhone sales by 7.7 percent to nearly $56 billion in the latest quarter from a year ago.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That growth helped lift Apple’s profit by 11.4 percent to $22.3 billion. The numbers easily beat Wall Street expectations and were welcome news to Apple investors, who had watched the company’s typically strong growth suddenly evaporate over the past year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before Tuesday, Apple had posted <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/apple-earnings.html" title="">four consecutive quarters of shrinking profit</a>, the longest such streak since 2016.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Luca Maestri, Apple’s finance chief, said in an interview that demand for Apple’s newest iPhones — the iPhone 11 series, released in September — exceeded expectations. He attributed the strong sales to new features, like a better camera and longer battery life, as well as financing options to buy a new phone and a $50 price cut for the cheapest model.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Daniel Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, said there was pent-up demand for the new iPhones because many people had waited to upgrade their older devices. “This was a jaw-dropper in terms of how strong phone sales were,” he said. “Even more than the bulls were hoping for.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple also was lifted by some of its newer products.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple’s services revenue, or sales from its App Store and subscription products, rose by nearly 17 percent to $12.7 billion from the prior year. And sales in its so-called wearables division, which include the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones, grew by 37 percent to just over $10 billion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The growth in services and wearables “attests to the fact that the company continues to reinvent itself,” said Daniel Flax, an analyst at the investment firm Neuberger Berman.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple also showed continued improvement in China, its second-largest market after the United States. A year ago, Apple had to pre-empt<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/apple-revenue-decline-china.html" title=""> its earnings report</a> with news that its sales in China would come in much lower than forecast.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The news sent its stock sliding and raised fears that the slump was a precursor to global economic decline. Apple <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/apple-earnings-china.html" title="">reported that its sales</a> in the China region fell by nearly 27 percent that quarter, contributing to a slight decline in its overall profit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But since then, Apple’s business has rebounded, the global economy has remained largely stable, and the company’s stock has roughly doubled. On Tuesday, Apple said its sales in the China region increased for the first time in five quarters, growing 3.1 percent. Mr. Maestri, the Apple executive, attributed the company’s improving fortunes in China partly to the strengthening economy there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple’s revenue rose by almost 9 percent to $91.8 billion. The company forecast that its revenue would rise 9 percent to 15 percent in the current quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts that Apple’s forecast was less precise than typical because the company was uncertain about the impact from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html" title="">the rapidly spreading coronavirus</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to its large sales presence in China, Apple also assembles most of its products there. Mr. Cook said that some Apple suppliers would remain closed into February as a precaution from the virus, and that traffic into its retail stores in the country had also fallen off.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple shares rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple’s recent success on the stock market has reflected a number of good signs for its business, including easing trade tensions between China and the United States. Apple is among the companies with the most at risk in a trade war between the two countries, given its enormous manufacturing and sales presence in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the latest quarter, Apple debuted one of its biggest efforts to expand its services business: Apple TV Plus, a package of exclusive TV shows produced by Apple that costs $5 a month, cheaper than most offerings from rivals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-battled-apple-tv-plus-in-2019-first-streaming-war-and-won-big/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">early market estimates</a> suggest the service has not been a big draw for new paying subscribers over the first several months, in part because Apple is giving a free year subscription to the service to anyone who buys a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac computer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Part of Apple’s strategy to expand its services business is to continue to increase the number of people using its devices. On Tuesday, Apple said there were more than 1.5 billion active Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, up from about 1.4 billion a year ago.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, sales of some of Apple’s older products fell in the quarter. Mac revenue decreased 3.5 percent and, on the week of the iPad’s 10th anniversary, its sales declined 11.2 percent.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

In the U.S. so far, there are five confirmed patients, all of whom had traveled to the hardest-hit part of China — and no sign that they have spread the illness to anyone around them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, “this is a very fast-moving, constantly changing situation,” Azar added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Flanked by the government's top infection specialists, Azar listed the biggest unanswered questions of the outbreak and tried to tamp down some of the fear and speculation provoked by China's rising toll:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">—How deadly is this new virus? China's death toll has passed 100 but the first patients counted in an outbreak “are naturally the most severe cases” and “skew our understanding,” Azar cautioned. Over time, if doctors find many more people had just a mild, cold-like illness, the death rate will change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">—How easily does it spread? One way to measure that is an estimate of how many people could catch an infection from one contagious patient. Some reports have suggested that number might be between 1.5 and 3.5 for the new coronavirus, but Azar stressed it's too soon to know. For comparison, one patient with measles could spread it to 12 to 18 others, he added. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">—What about silent carriers? Reports from China suggest some people may have spread the virus before showing symptoms. And Germany on Tuesday said a man with the virus near Munich never traveled to China or had close contact with anyone showing symptoms. Instead, he may have been infected by a coworker from China who briefly visited for a company training session and didn't report feeling ill until her flight home. Later authorities confirmed three additional cases from the German company, all connected to the first.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some viruses, such as the flu, can spread before symptoms are obvious. But there's no evidence it's happened with the new virus in the U.S., where health officials are checking contacts of the sick. And epidemics are driven by the openly sick, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief of the National Institutes of Health.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants to send its own scientists to visit China for a first-hand look try to answer those questions. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it hopes to send in international experts soon.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Without a vaccine or treatments, the world is depending on tried-and-true public health steps to tamp down the outbreak — finding the infected early and isolating them to stem the spread. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the U.S., the CDC is beefing up its checks of incoming travelers. It already had been screening for illness among passengers arriving from the epicenter of China's outbreak at five U.S. airports. But people who've visited other parts of China still may be arriving, with stops in other places first. Now, CDC is sending extra staff to other “quarantine stations” to screen arrivals at a total of 18 airports around the country and at two border crossings, in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The State Department has also chartered a plane to evacuate diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak started, and some other Americans. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked if those evacuees would be quarantined, Azar said there will be doctors on the flight to check all the passengers so health officials can decide if additional steps are needed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With an incubation period of anywhere from two to 14 days, travelers may arrive showing no symptoms. But CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier said the screenings are an opportunity to educate travelers that if they start feeling sick — with a fever, cough or flu-like symptoms — after returning from an outbreak zone, they should contact their doctor. That's exactly what the first U.S. patients did.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Azar said he has directed $105 million to fight the outbreak. Among the next steps, the CDC developed a test for the virus and aims to make it usable by state health departments, to speed diagnosis of suspected cases. Research also is under way to develop a vaccine or treatment. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Airport screenings were initially done in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Atlanta. That has been expanded to Anchorage, Alaska; Boston; Dallas; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Honolulu; Houston, Miami, Minneapolis; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; San Diego; Seattle; Washington, D.C. (Dulles); and San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> ___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">AP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York contributed to this report.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

That’s up from $142 in January 2019 after Apple warned that consumers weren’t buying as many new iPhones as they once were, especially in China, the company’s biggest market outside the U.S. and Europe. China is also where Apple makes most of its iPhones and several other products.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If the shares move similarly in Wednesday's regular trading session, they will flirt with a new all-time high for the stock and further cement Apple's position as the most valuable company in the U.S., with a market value of $1.4 trillion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A deadly viral outbreak in China, which has curtailed travel and threatens the world economy, looms as a potential concern for Apple. But investors for now are focusing on what looks like an even more prosperous road ahead for a company that turned a $55 billion profit in its past fiscal year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a conference call Tuesday, CEO Tim Cook said the coronavirus outbreak has already caused some of Apple's suppliers in China to delay reopening their factories closed for the Lunar New Year holiday from the end of this month until Feb. 10. And some stores in China selling Apple products already have temporarily closed or reduced their operating hours because fewer customers are shopping as virus worries escalate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely," Cook said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple got off to a fast start for fiscal 2020, with a first-quarter profit of $22.2 billion, or $4.99 per share, on revenue of $91.8 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted earnings of $4.54 per share on revenue of $88.5 billion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As usual, the iPhone remained Apple’s marquee attraction. Boosted by the release of the iPhone 11 heading into the holiday season, the product generated sales of $56 billion, an 8% increase from the previous year’s disappointing showing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Besides rolling out high-end phones with more cameras and a starting price of $1,000, Apple sold a more basic model starting at $700 — a $50 drop from a comparable version released in 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple’s division that includes its app store, product warranties, music streaming and a new Netflix-like video service delivered revenue of $12.7 billion, up 17% from the previous year. Apple is hoping its service division will produce revenue of at least $50 billion this year, doubling its output in just four years. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The services division is feeding into all iPhones, iPads, Macs and other Apple products already being used, which the company said Tuesday now totals 1.5 billion devices, up by 100 million from the previous year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We see this as a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers — and a great driver of our growth across the board," Cook said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Apple TV Plus video streaming service, which Apple launched amid great fanfare in October, is supposed to help that cause, but it may not be a huge contributor this year. That’s because Apple is initially selling it for just $5 per month to help drum up interest. That's less than half the price of Netflix’s most popular plan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What’s more, Apple is giving away a free year of Apple TV Plus to anyone who buys a new iPhone or several other devices, a promotion that means tens of millions of people aren’t paying anything for the service yet. Apple hasn't released subscription numbers for the video service.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meanwhile, the Apple Watch, which the company began selling nearly five years ago, continued to gain new converts, and the latest version of its wireless earbuds, AirPods, emerged as a hot commodity during the holiday season.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple introduced the AirPods after removing the headphone jack from the iPhone in 2016, but the product picked up more momentum in October with a next-generation set designed to fit better in people’s ears. That version, called AirPods Pro, proved so popular that Apple had trouble keeping it in stock. The AirPods Pro also cost more at $250, compared with $160 to $200 for the previous models.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All those factors helped Apple’s “wearables, home and accessories” category garner sales totaling $10 billion in the past quarter, a 37% increase from the previous year. That prompted Cook to hail it as a “blowout” quarter for the wearables and accessories division, which is now Apple's fastest growing category.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]
[<p>Advertisement</p>, <p>Supported by</p>, <p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70"></p>, <h1 class="css-1j5ig2m e1h9rw200" id="link-385bb3a8" itemprop="headline"><span>For Fed,' Material Reassessment' May Be in Eye of Beholder</span></h1>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">Reuters</span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — At a glance, the Federal Reserve has set a high bar for any change in interest rates this year: A "material reassessment" of the economic outlook would be required as set forth by U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since introducing that idea in October as he called a halt to last year's mini-rate cut cycle, Powell himself has uttered the term at least half a dozen times, and the phrase has peppered remarks from other policymakers as well.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But a closer listen reveals significant distinctions among the Fed's 17 policymakers as to what "material reassessment" means. And that may complicate efforts to understand what might prompt the next rate move as economic data spool out during the U.S. presidential election campaign this year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Obvious shocks will matter, and the sharp shift in markets following a coronavirus outbreak in China shows just how fast unexpected events can start to reshape the outlook. Major stock indexes were down sharply on Monday, oil prices and the U.S. dollar rose, and economic analysts saw a potential hit to Chinese and possibly global economic growth as the death toll from the virus rose and a major Chinese city was quarantined. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Carefully watched bond spreads narrowed, and investors started pushing forward their estimates of a Fed rate move, with now roughly even odds the central bank will cut rates again by the end of June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What will convince individual policymakers, however, varies widely. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(GRAPHIC: The Fed's material world - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1526/1501/Pasted%20Image.jpg)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Will consumer behavior be the obvious tell, as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic thinks? That would leave rates on hold as long as people keep spending.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Or, as Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari contends, would the failure of wages to grow faster be a sign the economy is weakening and be enough on its own to warrant more rate cuts?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What if inflation remains stuck below the Fed's 2% target? Would that warrant a rate cut in hopes of lifting it? St. Louis Fed President James Bullard suggests so, calling it the Fed's "unifying theme ... That (inflation) has got to get better."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not so fast, says Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. "I would not at this point want to take deliberate action just to try to get inflation back up," she said in a recent interview.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mester is concerned last year's three rate cuts could encourage excessive risk taking by households, companies and investors taking advantage of cheap credit. On the other hand, a "deterioration" of public attitudes about inflation might change her mind.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fed officials will continue their debate when they gather on Tuesday for the first policy meeting of the year. Financial markets do not expect the Fed to change its benchmark overnight lending rate at the end of the meeting on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">'OPEN TO INTERPRETATION'</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economic data since the Fed's last meeting in December have, if anything, enforced the central bank's consensus view of an economy that will keep motoring along, though some of the numbers have been uneven. December jobs and retail spending were healthy, for example, but the outlook from factory purchasing managers was sour for a fifth straight month. Growth overall is expected to be around 2% for the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Mester notes, it adds to the dilemma of sorting out just what could change the Fed's current "wait-and-see" approach.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I do think our communications could be crisper," she said earlier this month in reference to what "material reassessment" means. "We use words like that, and they are open to interpretation." </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That may have been the point. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both "material reassessment" and the need for "persistent" higher inflation were introduced as rate change benchmarks through a less formal channel. Rather than appearing in the Fed's official statement after each policy meeting, they came from Powell himself in press conferences in October and December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His comments left open just what could prompt a move lower, and just how high or "persistent" inflation would need to be for the Fed to lean against it with higher rates. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Minutes of the October policy meeting as well as recent interviews with policymakers indicate the aim of the new language was to keep a high bar for further moves while also letting each official see it as consistent with their view of what is needed to move again in either direction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So where Mester remains focused on financial stability as a reason not to cut rates, Bullard suggests a quicker trigger if prices remain stuck because "you have to take some risk" with a higher pace of inflation to convince the public the Fed's target is meaningful.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">'BIG-TENT LANGUAGE' </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed has run into problems before when it tried to resolve background disagreements with public remarks outside the official statement. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In preparing to slow its bond purchases in 2013, policymakers left much of the explaining to then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke. That ended with a broad sell-off in global bond markets, known as the "taper tantrum," when the Fed's plans came off as more aggressive than intended.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That lesson learned, when the Fed changed its language in late 2014 to indicate officials would be "patient" in deciding when to raise rates for the first time since the financial crisis, they agreed the word should be explicitly defined by Bernanke's successor, Janet Yellen, in her press conference. She clarified it meant at least a two-meeting wait.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Minutes of the October meeting, when the Fed cut rates for the third and, for now, final time, suggest the phrase "material reassessment" served this time as a sort of handy catch-all. "Most participants" agreed it would describe their sensitivity to upcoming events after that final rate cut, even if they emphasized different things. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It wasn't unanimous. "A couple" of policymakers on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee wanted more explicit language to say no further cuts were coming unless economic data was "consistent with a significant slowdown."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it did offer flexibility for a policymaking body that may have reached a common landing spot for now. No one is openly arguing for a change in rates anytime soon, though they have different ideas about where to go next.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It is big-tent language," Bullard said. "It matters that it is not in the statement. The committee did not have to come to a decision to put it in. That probably does mean that different people will have different interpretations."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Howard Schneider; Additional reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Dan Burns and Paul Simao)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Here’s the latest.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">1. President Trump’s defense team</strong> wrapped up its oral arguments, urging the Senate to “end the era of impeachment” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/politics/trumps-defense-team-discounts-bolton-as-republicans-work-to-hold-off-witnesses.html" title="">by declaring the president not guilty</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His lawyers, above, derided a new claim by Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, that Mr. Trump had tied the release of military aid to Ukraine to investigations into the Bidens as an “unsourced allegation” that should be “inadmissible” in the trial.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the past three days, the president’s team has focused less on defending Mr. Trump’s actions than on convincing senators that those actions did not rise to impeachable offenses. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starting Wednesday, senators will spend up to 16 hours over two days questioning each side’s lawyers. A vote on whether to hear witnesses in the trial is expected on Friday. Senator Mitch McConnell is said to have told Republicans that he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-28#mcconnell-democrats-witnesses" title="">does not currently have the votes</a> to block the measure. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. President Trump</strong> unveiled his Middle East peace plan in Washington in the presence of only one party in the conflict, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What Mr. Trump called a “win-win” proposal <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html" title="">guarantees Israeli control of a unified Jerusalem</a>, does not require it to uproot any West Bank settlements and creates a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty. Analysts saw the document as a distraction offered by a president under impeachment working with a prime minister under criminal indictment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Palestinian leadership immediately rejected the proposal, which discards the idea of a full-fledged Palestinian state. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-annex-sovereignty.html" title="">Israel’s government plans a vote on Sunday</a> that would apply Israeli sovereignty to West Bank settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. In Britain, </strong>Prime Minister Boris Johnson broke with President Trump over Huawei.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite pressure on Britain to bar the Chinese technology giant from its new 5G broadband network, Mr. Johnson <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/britain-huawei-5G.html" title="">decided to grant Huawei limited access</a>. It is the latest sign that the U.S. campaign against Huawei is faltering.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The move also creates <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/europe/johnson-trump-hwawei-rift.html" title="">a possible rift between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Trump</a> at the very moment that Britain is leaving the European Union, and before talks toward a trans-Atlantic trade deal. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4. The number of known cases</strong> of the coronavirus rose by nearly 60 percent overnight. Above, disinfection in Qingdao, China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China said confirmed cases had increased to 4,515, and that 106 people had died. The youngest case is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/asia/china-travel-coronoavirus.html" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As infections skyrocketed, officials expanded travel restrictions and screenings. Hong Kong said the territory would strictly limit visitors from mainland China, and the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/airports-screening-coronavirus.html" title="">U.S. will screen travelers</a> arriving from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, at 20 ports of entry, up from five.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. In the 2020 race, </strong>we take a look at Pete Buttigieg’s struggle with minority voters — and his campaign staff.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some staff members of color said working for a candidate with so <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/politics/buttigieg-campaign-black-hispanic-staff.html" title="">little support from black and Hispanic voters</a> had become demoralizing. One said that people of color felt they were employed in order to help the campaign meet its ambitious diversity targets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Elsewhere on the campaign trail, President Trump’s impeachment trial is keeping senators far from Iowa for the second week in a row, so <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/politics/democrats-iowa-aoc.html" title="">their stand-ins have become the main attraction</a>. Among them are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the actress Ashley Judd and Jonathan Van Ness of “Queer Eye.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6. Kobe Bryant’s impact </strong>was felt far beyond the basketball court.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We spoke to one of his high school English teachers about their friendship, which endured <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/us/kobe-bryant-lower-merion-jeanne-mastriano.html" title="">over more than two decades</a>. “We managed to get through lots of years, and really were there for each other,” Jeanne Mastriano, pictured above with Bryant last year, told us.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/kobe-bryant-philadelphia.html" title="">His high school team is set to play tonight</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Our former deputy sports editor reflects on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/kobe-bryant-fans.html" title="">why Bryant’s death means so much to so many</a>, and Talia Caldwell, a professional women’s basketball player, writes in Opinion about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/opinion/kobe-bryant-women-basketball.html" title="">why the W.N.B.A. loved him</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Investigators said they would explore all possible causes of Sunday’s helicopter crash, including mechanical failure. They also said that all nine bodies had now been recovered. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-death.html" title="">Here are the latest developments</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7. After a second nail-biting victory</strong> in the Australian Open, Roger Federer will face off against Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer saved seven match points against Tennys Sandgren in the fourth set of their quarterfinal, and will now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/tennis/australian-open-federer-djokovic.html" title="">play Djokovic for the 50th time</a> early Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ashleigh Barty is two wins away from winning a Grand Slam title in her home country, which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/tennis/australian-open-ashleigh-barty.html" title="">no Australian woman has done since 1978</a>. She is scheduled to play Sofia Kenin, an American who is seeded 14th, on Thursday for a spot in the final.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">8. Fort Worth </strong>is embracing its cowboy culture with an eye toward the future. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Texas city of nearly 900,000 people is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/fort-worth-dickies-arena-rodeo.html" title="">taking advantage of its longhorn heritage</a> with hopes to become a major sports and entertainment center. Its new $540 million arena will host one of the world’s oldest indoor rodeos, and the city is reinvigorating its stockyards district.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Our architecture critic is thinking about city planning in a different way. For many, the word “density” conjures up overcrowding and congestion. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/arts/density-housing-skyscraper-museum.html" title="">But density is not the enemy, he says</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">9. Pop-ups</strong> were once seen by young chefs as a steppingstone to a restaurant. Now, they are using the temporary eateries as a way to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/dining/pop-up-dinners.html" title="">explore their personal memories and culinary traditions</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We want to recreate a Sunday night at my grandma’s place,” said Stephanie Bonnin, above, a Colombian-born chef.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the beverage scene, we also looked at how mead went from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/nyregion/mead-honey-wine-brooklyn-new-york.html" title="">a medieval honey wine</a> to New York’s next cool drink, and went on a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/travel/costa-rica-coffee-tours.html" title="">four-day coffee tasting journey in Costa Rica</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">10. And finally, </strong>capturing the unexpected. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wedding photographers usually have a shot list — a must-capture catalog of photos that each couple insists on — but there’s a certain delight in the spontaneous, like a snowy parking lot in Snoqualmie, Wash., above. We asked 12 photographers to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/fashion/weddings/wedding-photographers-share-their-favorite-moments.html" title="">share their most candid shots</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You always look for these rare moments,” one longtime wedding photographer said. “They don’t always happen, but when they do, it’s magic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And if you think you have one that fits the bill, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/fashion/weddings/wedding-album-do-you-have-an-unexpected-photo-from-your-wedding-day.html" title="">you can submit it here</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Have an unexpectedly lovely night.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/briefing/global-morning-briefing-newsletter-signup.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to get it by email in the Australian, Asian, European, African or American morning.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Want to catch up on past briefings? </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-evening-briefing" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">You can browse them here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">What did you like?

Thousands of people flooded Wuhan's hospitals, which pleaded for donations of masks, disinfectant and medical supplies as overworked doctors and nurses grappled with the crowds. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It wasn’t long before simmering anger exploded online. Hundreds fumed at a report on the festivities on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, asking why officials were enjoy gala shows instead of dealing with the epidemic or shortages of supplies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As China institutes one of the largest quarantines in modern history, locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, questions are swirling about the city and provincial governments’ sluggish initial response to an outbreak that has infected thousands of people and killed more than 100. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For two weeks, from Jan. 5 to 16, the city reported virtually no new cases, while hundreds of officials gathered in Wuhan, the provincial capital, for Hubei's two biggest political meetings of the year. It was only after a medical team dispatched by the National Health Commission went to investigate on Jan. 19 that the severity of the situation became public.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Wuhan must immediately change its chief!” Zhang Oufa, a journalist with the government-run Hubei Daily newspaper, thundered in a Weibo post. “Under these abnormal, grave circumstances that keep getting worse by the day, Wuhan’s current leader just doesn’t have what it takes to lead!”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His comments were swiftly removed. The paper rushed out an apology, saying it was deeply sorry for “disrupting ongoing work on epidemic prevention” and “causing difficulties for leaders at various levels.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Zhang has continued to post thinly veiled criticisms of city officials, and leading business magazine Caixin has published stories from the front lines, interviewing exhausted doctors and nurses and reporting long waits and supply shortages. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fact that these reports are getting through China's censors is likely a tacit sign of the central leadership’s displeasure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Wuhan authorities clearly downplayed or made efforts to hide the situation for an extended period of time,” said Dali Yang, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. “It turned out to be one of the worst decisions that they'll regret all their lives.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, defended his actions in an unusually tough interview with state broadcaster CCTV on Monday, offering to step down over his decision to close the city — not because of any delays in reporting the epidemic. He said the city government was slow to disclose information about the virus due to national regulations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“As a local government official, I could disclose information only after being authorized,” Zhou said. "A lot of people didn’t understand this.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Phone calls to the Wuhan party committee publicity department rang unanswered Monday and Tuesday, and their fax machines were turned off.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese health officials informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on Dec. 31. By Jan. 8, it had been identified as a new coronavirus, a large family that causes the common cold and more serious illnesses including SARS, which also began in China. By Jan. 12, Chinese scientists had sequenced the virus’ genetic makeup and shared it with WHO, drawing praise for their transparency and swift action.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In contrast, the Wuhan heath commission reported no new cases from Jan. 5 to 10 and again from Jan. 12 to 16. China’s Lunar New Year rush —the world’s largest annual human migration — began to get underway, with millions of people passing through Wuhan, a major transit hub.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A recently submitted complaint to the National Health Commission alleged that during this period, officials with the Wuhan health commission told doctors they were not allowed to report about the new virus, letting patients wander around freely instead of being isolated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have countless medical workers who, because they weren't aware of the situation, got cut down at the front lines,” said the complaint, whose author said they were a Wuhan doctor. “Because of the coverup of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission and other leaders, they made unnecessary sacrifices!"</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A volunteer coordinating donations to hospitals in Wuhan heard from doctors and nurses that in early January, it became apparent that many medical workers treating patients were falling ill themselves. They raised the alarm, but with little effect.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The sluggish response meant that for weeks, medical staff made do without proper protection, the volunteer said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution against the doctors and nurses. Even now, some medical staff are using garbage bags and cut-up water bottles as makeshift gowns and masks, the volunteer said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When we first discovered it could be transmitted between people, our hospital head, chairman, medical affairs department, they sat and made endless calls to the city government, the health commission,” one nurse, who fell ill and was put in isolation, wrote in messages shared by the volunteer. “They said we still can’t wear protective clothing, because it might stir up panic.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not all the blame can be placed on local officials, health and governance experts say. The broader issue is that local officials can be punished for reporting bad news to higher officials. The Chinese government’s rigidity, and a lack of transparency and accountability to the general public means problems like the virus epidemic can fester hidden away until it is too late.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s a tendency in terms of the Chinese bureaucratic accountability system to view a governance failure as the fault of a particular government official or group of officials, as opposed to a symptom of a broader governance challenge,” says John Yasuda, an Indiana University professor studying politics and regulatory failures in China. “Officials are likely to be a bit more hesitant to report simply because they don't want to be caught with the hot potato.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the National Health Commission team came to Wuhan to investigate on Jan. 19, tens of thousands of people tucked into a mass banquet of 13,986 dishes contributed from neighborhood families. Pictures in state media showed nobody wearing masks while they shared rice cakes, fish, and other Lunar New Year delicacies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even after the head of the team announced that the virus could spread from person to person, and the number of reported cases began soaring, crowds of pedestrians thronged the streets of Wuhan early last week. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I heard about it earlier this month, but I didn’t pay much attention,” said Helen Cao on Jan. 21, pausing after an afternoon shopping on Wuhan’s busiest pedestrian street. “It should be fine. All the sick people are in hospitals, it’s not really an emergency.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Growing anxiety over the virus is evoking memories of the ruling Communist Party’s slow response to the 2002 emergence of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Even after SARS had spread globally, China sought to conceal the number of cases by parking patients in hotels and obscure hospital wings, and driving them around in ambulances to avoid detection by World Health Organization experts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time, action from the central government has been swifter. There are signs the central government in Beijing may act against city and provincial-level officials it deems responsible for the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s cabinet, the State Council, issued a public call Friday for whistleblowers, opening up channels for people to submit complaints about cover-ups or delays in reporting cases. It promised cases would be “dealt with seriously."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for the study of global health at the Council of Foreign Relations, believes authorities are being much more responsive, now that the central government has acted. But Huang says the fact that the disease had been allowed to fester for so long shows deep-rooted problems with increasingly strict political controls under President Xi Jinping.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The atmosphere is such now, we see rapid centralization of political power,” Huang said “That created a political atmosphere where people are afraid to speak up… They are very reluctant to share any useful information, and that is actually becoming a challenge.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A 63-year-old retiree who would be identified only his last name, Xia, said he had to stay overnight Thursday to get his feverish wife care, waiting in lines with nearly a hundred people for a doctor’s check and a CT scan and staying in the hospital until 7 in the morning. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Xia wondered why there were so few medical staff, and saw a nurse passed out in exhaustion. When he got home, he saw notices online telling sick people to stay home and avoid bothering overworked hospitals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I feel very helpless,” he said by phone, despite warnings from a superior not to speak to media. “Who’s going to give us advice or suggestions? I have no friends working in hospitals.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Amid Wuhan's now-empty streets and pharmacies running low on supplies, Xia feels more and more anxious. He hopes help will soon be on the way.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Ordinary people really hope the government will take action instead of make empty talk,” he said. “I trust the government.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Researchers may use the lab-grown virus to test antiviral drugs or develop experimental vaccines, Dr. Hotez said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By growing the novel coronavirus in controlled conditions, researchers also may get a better understanding of why the virus seems to be transmitted more easily than the SARS coronavirus, yet so far seems to have a lower mortality rate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are trying to grow the coronavirus from patient samples collected in the United States.

Other cases, however, appear to have spread between people with different connections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Japan, a tour bus driver in his 60s who had driven two different groups from Wuhan, China, was confirmed to have the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday. The driver had no history of traveling to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think what that says is, if we can get transmission in such a setting, then we can certainly get it in the waiting room of a clinic or a hospital,” Professor Reingold said. “That’s very concerning.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">German officials said on Tuesday that a 33-year-old man from Starnberg in Bavaria was apparently infected with the coronavirus after a Jan. 21 training event with a Chinese colleague. The Chinese colleague flew home two days later. The German man was being treated under isolation while officials identified other people with whom he might have been in contact.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Late Tuesday, health officials in Germany said three more people from the same company in Bavaria were also infected.

And as a New York Times correspondent in China, I covered the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">SARS outbreak</a> in 2002 and 2003 during which a novel coronavirus first detected in Guangdong sickened more than 8,000 people and killed more than 800. My two children attended elementary school in Beijing throughout the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here are my main takeaways from that experience for ordinary people on the ground:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">1. Wash your hands frequently.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">2. Don’t go to the office when you are sick. Don’t send your kids to school or day care when they are ill, either.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Notice I didn’t say anything about masks. Having a mask with you as a precaution makes sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak, as I was when out reporting in the field during those months. But wearing it constantly is another matter. I donned a mask when visiting hospitals where SARS patients had been housed. I wore it in the markets where wild animals that were the suspected source of the outbreak were being butchered, blood droplets flying. I wore it in crowded enclosed spaces that I couldn’t avoid, like airplanes and trains, as I traveled to cities involved in the outbreak, like Guangzhou and Hong Kong. You never know if the guy coughing and sneezing two rows ahead of you is ill or just has an allergy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But outdoors, infections don’t spread well through the air. Those photos of people walking down streets in China wearing masks are dramatic but uninformed. And remember if a mask has, perchance, intercepted viruses that would have otherwise ended up in your body, then the mask is contaminated. So, in theory, to be protected maybe you should use a new one for each outing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The simple masks are better than nothing, but not all that effective, since they don’t seal well. For anyone tempted to go out and buy the gold standard, N95 respirators, note that they are uncomfortable. Breathing is more work. It’s hard to talk to people. On one long flight at the height of the outbreak, on which my few fellow passengers were mostly epidemiologists trying to solve the SARS puzzle, many of us (including me) wore our masks for the first couple of hours on the flight. Then the food and beverage carts came.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though viruses spread through droplets in the air, a bigger worry to me was always transmission via what doctors call “fomites,” infected items. A virus gets on a surface — a shoe or a doorknob or a tissue, for example. You touch the surface and then next touch your face or rub your nose. It’s a great way to acquire illness. So after walking in the animal markets, I removed my shoes carefully and did not take them into the hotel room. And of course I washed my hands immediately.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Remember, by all indications SARS, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/how-the-new-coronavirus-differs-from-sars-measles-and-ebola/2020/01/23/aac6bb06-3e1b-11ea-b90d-5652806c3b3a_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">which killed about 10 percent</a> of those infected, was a deadlier virus than the new coronavirus circulating now. So keep things in perspective.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Faced with SARS, many foreigners chose to leave Beijing or at least to send their children back to the United States. Our family stayed, kids included. We wanted them with us and didn’t want them to miss school, especially during what would be their final year in China. But equally important in making the decision was that the risk of getting SARS on an airplane or in the airport seemed greater than being smart and careful while staying put in Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And we were: I stopped taking my kids to indoor playgrounds or crowded malls or delicious but densely packed neighborhood Beijing restaurants. Out of an abundance of caution we canceled a family vacation to Cambodia — though my fear was less about catching SARS on the flight than that one of the kids would have a fever from an ear infection upon our return at a border screening, and would be stuck in a prolonged quarantine in China. We instead took a vacation within China, where we carried masks with us but didn’t use them except on a short domestic flight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In time, during the SARS outbreak, the government shut down theaters and schools in Beijing, as it is doing now in many Chinese cities because these viruses are more easily transmitted in such crowded places.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there was also a lot of irrational behavior: Entering a village on the way to a hike near the Great Wall, our car was stopped by locals who had set up a roadblock to check the temperature of all passengers. They used an oral thermometer that was only minimally cleaned after each use. What a great way to spread a virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The International School of Beijing, where my children were students, was one of the few in the capital — perhaps the only one — that stayed open throughout the SARS outbreak, though the classes were emptier, since so many kids had departed to their home countries. It was a studied but brave move, since a parent at the school had gotten SARS at the very beginning of the outbreak on a flight back from Hong Kong. She recovered fine, but it was close to home and families were scared.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The school instituted a bunch of simple precautionary policies: a stern note to parents reminding them not to send a child to school who was sick and warning them that students would be screened for fevers with ear thermometers at the school door. There was no sharing of food at lunch. The teacher led the kids in frequent hand washing throughout the day at classroom sinks, while singing a prolonged “hand washing song” to ensure they did more than a cursory pass under the faucet with water only.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If a family left Beijing and came back, the child would have to stay at home for an extended period before returning to class to make sure they hadn’t caught SARS elsewhere.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With those precautions in place, I observed something of a public health miracle: Not only did no child get SARS, but it seemed no student was sick with anything at all for months on end. No stomach bugs. No common colds. Attendance was more or less perfect.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/world-health-organization-declares-sars-contained-worldwide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">declared the SARS outbreak contained</a> in July 2003. But, oh, that those habits persisted. The best first-line defenses against SARS or the new coronavirus or most any virus at all are the ones that Grandma and common sense taught us, after all.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"></p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

Will It Help?</span></h1>, <p class="css-1ifw933 e1wiw3jv0" id="article-summary">New technology and better coordination have sped up development. But a coronavirus vaccine is still months — and most likely years — away.</p>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <a class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/knvul-sheikh"><span class="css-1baulvz" itemprop="name">Knvul Sheikh</span></a> and <a class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-thomas"><span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">Katie Thomas</span></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the early days of January, as cases of a strange, pneumonia-like illness were reported in China, researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland readied themselves to hunt for a vaccine to prevent the new disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They had clues that a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">coronavirus</a>, similar to ones that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 and MERS in 2012, was the culprit. Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the N.I.H, urged government scientists in China to share the genetic makeup of the virus so his team could begin its race to develop a vaccine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Friday, Jan. 10, the Chinese scientists posted the information on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a public database</a>. The next morning, Dr. Graham’s team was in the lab. And within hours, they had pinpointed the letters of the genetic code that could be used to make a vaccine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists in Australia and at least three companies — Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals — are also working on vaccine candidates to stop the spread of the disease, which has infected about 6,000 people and killed more than 130.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Everybody is trying to move as quickly as possible,” said Jacqueline Shea, the chief operating officer at Inovio.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Inovio received a grant of up to $9 million to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a group whose aim is to speed vaccines to market. Moderna, which is working with Dr. Graham’s team at the N.I.H., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">received a similar grant</a>, as did researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Historically, vaccines have been one of the greatest public health tools to prevent disease. But even as new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to move at unprecedented speed, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process. It takes months and even years because the vaccines must undergo extensive testing in animals and humans. In the best case, it takes at least a year — and most likely longer — for any vaccine to become available to the public.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They may not help in the very early stages of an outbreak, but if we’re able to develop vaccines in time, they will be an asset later,” said Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the epidemic preparedness coalition.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in 2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they hope the joint efforts will cut that time in half.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The morning after the Chinese scientists published their data earlier this month, Dr. Graham’s team got to work checking the sequence and comparing it with what they already had for SARS and MERS. They wanted to focus on the spike protein, which forms the crown of the coronavirus and recognizes receptors, or entry points, on a host cell.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you can block the spike protein from binding to a cell, then you’ve effectively prevented an infection,” said Kizzmekia Corbett, the scientific lead for Dr. Graham’s coronavirus team.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Corbett and others had studied the spike proteins on SARS and MERS viruses in detail, using them to develop experimental vaccines. The vaccines never made it to market because SARS was successfully contained with public health measures before the vaccine was ready and preliminary<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30266-X/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> human trials for the MERS vaccine showed success</a> last year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the scientists had a method for developing vaccines that could help them fast-track production for the new coronavirus. They used the template for the SARS vaccine and swapped in just enough genetic code that would make it work for the new virus. “I call it plug and play,” Dr. Corbett said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within a few hours, Dr. Corbett was able to prepare the modified sequence that the researchers needed. On Tuesday, Jan. 14, the team held a conference call to discuss the next steps with collaborators in labs across the country, and sent off the sequence to Moderna.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists at the company plan to use the genetic information to create synthetic messenger RNA, which carries instructions for cells’ protein-making machinery. The technology will help induce high levels of antibodies that can identify the spike protein and fight off an infection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once Moderna manufactures the messenger RNA in a few weeks, the N.I.H. will run more tests, Dr. Corbett said. Collaborators in academic labs will then test the vaccine in mice infected with the virus and check blood samples from the animals to see how well the experimental vaccine worked.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham’s team, said he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,” he said, referring to early human trials that test for safety.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other researchers are using different methods to develop their vaccines.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Inovio, which is also developing a vaccine for MERS, uses a DNA-based technology. Johnson &amp; Johnson delivers vaccines through adenoviruses — which can cause coldlike symptoms but have been made harmless. And researchers at the University of Queensland are testing particles that mimic the structure of a virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t know which vaccine approach will be successful at this stage, so we have to try everything in our arsenal,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In interviews, company executives said that partnerships with governments and philanthropic foundations were essential to developing vaccines for outbreaks because there <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/health/without-lucrative-market-potential-ebola-vaccine-was-shelved-for-years.html" title="">are so many uncertainties</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Paul Stoffels, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s chief scientific officer, estimated it could take eight to 12 months before his company’s vaccines reach human clinical trials. By then, it is possible the coronavirus outbreak will have been contained. Testing of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Zika vaccine is currently halted, he said, because new outbreaks of the disease have slowed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You have to be brave and you have to be a solid company to do this, because there is no real incentive to do this, no financial incentive,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said vaccines were necessary, even if an outbreak wanes, because it could always return. “I think it’s important to be prepared,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts believe that the frequency of outbreaks will only increase because of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/climate/dengue-mosquito-spread-map.html" title="">climate change</a>, urbanization and global travel, among other factors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We probably need to start thinking about putting in a special infrastructure for coronavirus infections the same way we have for the flu,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, who is co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and was involved in the production of a SARS vaccine that may be repurposed for the new coronavirus. The detection and monitoring of infections, as well as the development of vaccines, will put an insurance policy in place for future outbreaks, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re just starting to realize that the power of vaccines goes way beyond public health,” he said. “They are also critical to the global economy and global security.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Ford and Toyota will idle some of their vast Chinese assembly plants for an extra week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, British Airways and Air Canada suspended all flights to mainland China, and Delta joined the growing number of carriers reducing service. Japan’s leaders are bracing for a possible hit and the Federal Reserve is “very carefully monitoring” the situation. Hotels and tour operators across Asia are watching fearfully as the world’s largest source of tourism dollars tightens its borders.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mysterious <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/upshot/coronavirus-risk-prevention-advice.html" title="">coronavirus</a> that has killed more than a hundred people and sickened thousands has virtually shut down one of the world’s most important growth engines. Desperate to slow the fast-moving virus, the Chinese authorities have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus-social-media.html" title="">extended the country’s national holiday</a> to Feb. 3, and crippled land, rail and air transport. Entire cities have shut down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-economy-strategy.html" title="">impoverished nation</a> just four decades ago, China has become an essential part of the modern global industrial machine. It alone accounts for roughly one-sixth of global economic output, and is the world’s largest manufacturer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s importance goes beyond what it makes. Its consumers buy more cars and smartphones than anybody else. When they go abroad, Chinese tourists spend $258 billion a year, according to the World Tourism Organization, nearly twice what Americans spend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it has become so crucial to the operations of American companies that some members of the Trump administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/business/china-us-trade-disengage.html" title="">cited that dependence</a> as a justification for the trade war that began two years ago, an economic conflict that is forcing businesses <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/business/china-trade-trump-jobs-decoupling.html" title="">to consider shifting their factories</a> in China to countries with better relations with Washington.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Global companies were reconsidering their China strategies even before the trade war started. China’s labor costs are rising, local companies are increasingly competitive and the government has become less accommodating. Still, its skilled worker base, extensive highway and rail systems and vast consumer market make China tough to quit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What is clear is that businesses were already reeling from multiple sources of uncertainty,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “It’s one more thing,” he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The full extent of the hit to the broader business world is not yet clear. The obvious comparison is to the deadly SARS outbreak 17 years ago, which began in China and killed hundreds globally. In early 2003, SARS slowed China’s growth substantially.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There will clearly be implications, at least in the near term, for Chinese output,” the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said during a news conference on Wednesday. “We just have to see what the effect is globally.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most of China had already been shut down since at least Friday for the annual Lunar New Year holiday, a weeklong nationwide hiatus. But with the outbreak showing no signs of slowing, many companies are already preparing for a longer slowdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our members are dealing with varying degrees of disruption in their businesses, including supply chain issues, temporary closings of some retail outlets and factories, and other challenges,” said Jake Parker, the senior vice president of the US-China Business Council, which represents major companies. If travel restrictions and quarantines are expanded or the holiday extended further, he said, “that will amplify these problems.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many companies are now looking for temporary stopgaps.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Automakers like General Motors and Nissan plan to close their factories until the week of Feb. 3 to comply with the longer mandated holiday, while Toyota and Ford said this week that they would close some of their factories a week longer than that because of virus-related disruptions. Companies like G.M., Honeywell, Facebook and Bloomberg restricted travel for employees in China and established their own self-quarantine measures.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, the Seattle-based coffee company Starbucks said it had closed more than half of its 4,292 stores in China, its second-biggest market after the United States, and said it would take a quarterly and full-year financial hit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said on Tuesday that the iPhone maker was looking for alternative suppliers to “make up for any expected production loss.” Foxconn, a Taiwanese company with an extensive network of factories in China that make gadgets on behalf of Apple and others, said its factories would continue to follow the new holiday schedule, which in some cases meant keeping operations closed until Feb. 10.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple is not the only company that has had to pivot quickly. Just last week, executives of Honeywell, the American engineering company, traveled to Wuhan for a ceremony related to its plans to open an innovation headquarters. Two days later, Wuhan was put under lockdown by the authorities. Honeywell has since restricted travel to certain parts of China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan in particular appeals to major companies because it is a major national transport hub. The auto industry, including General Motors, Honda, Nissan and many others, have set up shop there, and many of their suppliers have followed. It is the home to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/china-chine/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/96289.aspx?lang=eng" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more than one third</a> of all French investment in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, PSA Group, the French automaker, said it had set up crisis communications between Wuhan and its Paris headquarters to determine the potential impact on production. The company employs about 2,000 people in Wuhan through its joint venture and was evacuating 38 expatriates.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Swedish retail giant Ikea, which employs 14,000 people in China, said on Thursday it would temporarily close all of its 30 stores in the country. Employees at the stores will be asked to stay home with paid leave until further notice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is not clear how quickly businesses will bounce back. During the SARS outbreak, some factories paid higher wages to bring workers back and get factories humming again.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Right now, businesses do not know enough to make those kinds of plans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cummins, an Indiana company that makes engines and generators, does not know whether it will be able to open its seven sites in Wuhan after the Feb. 3 holiday extension because the city remains under lockdown. The facilities make fuel and power systems for rail and marine industries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Literally, we are evaluating on an ongoing basis in real time,” said Jon Mills, a spokesman for Cummins, “and I imagine other places are in the same position as we are.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ford, which does not have any operations in Wuhan, said several of its major plants would nevertheless be idled until Feb. 10. A spokesman declined to disclose further details. The factories in four cities churn out nearly half a million vehicles a year, or an average of 9,400 cars a week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Businesses in other countries are also trying to determine the impact.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If the situation takes longer to subside, we’re concerned it could hurt Japanese exports, output and corporate profits,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan’s minister of state for economic and fiscal policy, told a group of reporters this week. Chinese visitors account for about 30 percent of all foreign tourists, and Chinese companies are major buyers of Japanese-made components, like semiconductors and lenses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Thailand, Chinese sightseers spend nearly $18 billion annually, totaling about a quarter of tourist spending.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Chinese tourists are the No. 1 tourists to Thailand,” said Yuthasak Supasorn, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. He added that the government was exploring ways to compensate business owners who had lost money from the drop in tourists over the past few weeks.

Only when they are cleared will they be allowed to continue on home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities, however, were at pains to to say it was not a quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are respecting the rights of them as individuals,” said Dr. Nancy Knight, a senior official with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are doing that in a way that protects their health, the health of uniformed service members and the health of the community.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The passengers, mostly American consular officials and their families, returned to the United States as the coronavirus continued to spread around the globe, with the number of cases spiking dramatically and two major airlines canceling all flights to and from China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By early Thursday, there were confirmed reports of infection in at least 16 countries, with more than 7,700 cases in China alone — topping the SARS outbreak there in 2002 and 2003. The official death toll there stood at 170, but the real number is believed to be much higher. On Thursday, the World Health Organization will again take up the question of whether to declare a global health emergency.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As governments around the world struggle to detect and prevent infection, it was clear on Wednesday that there was no international consensus on the best way to proceed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">However carefully the health authorities chose their words, the evacuees in the United States, for example, appeared to be, for all practical purposes, quarantined. They will also be monitored for 14 days by medical teams in their own communities when they go home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said citizens evacuated from Wuhan would be held for a two-week quarantine on Christmas Island, also the site of an Australian immigration detention center.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 5, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And South Korea’s National Police Agency said that it had instructed its officers that they have the power to detain people who are suspected of carrying the coronavirus and refuse to be quarantined.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But other countries were taking a less strict approach.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan, for example, also evacuated citizens from China, but acquiesced when two evacuees who did not have symptoms declined to see a doctor. A third evacuee who did show symptoms was allowed to wait for test results at home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it spreads globally, the new coronavirus, which was first discovered in China last month, has begun to infect people who never visited China. Some have fallen ill in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’ve seen it spread between people in Wuhan, in other parts of China, and now these countries,” said Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What we don’t know is how quickly it spreads,” Dr. Cowling said. “We’ve seen small clusters, but we don’t know if those turn into chains of transmission that grow from two to four to eight to 16 — or if it can be controlled and won’t be further transmitted.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan — among them France, South Korea, Morocco, Germany, Kazakhstan, Britain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands and Myanmar — commercial airlines curtailed service to China. British Airways and Air Canada suspended flights altogether.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Americans who were repatriated on Wednesday landed at the air base shortly after 8 a.m. after the State Department-chartered flight stopped in Anchorage to refuel and for the passengers to be screened — twice — for the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a news conference later in Riverside, Christopher R. Braden, a deputy director of the disease control centers, said the Americans would be “fully evaluated.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We think we can do the full evaluation in three days,” Dr. Braden said. “Some of that evaluation is taking tests and flying samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta.” The agency has the country’s only laboratory that can test for the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a raucous, packed news conference, Dr. Braden and Dr. Knight were peppered with questions about the wisdom of releasing the former Wuhan residents into communities across the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Braden said that if an evacuee deemed a danger to the community insisted on leaving before the 72-hour period expired, “we can institute an individual quarantine for that person — and we will.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he also said there was no indication that anyone wanted to leave right away.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some Americans remained stranded in Wuhan, unable to secure a seat on the plane. Family members were incensed to learn that the Boeing 747 had taken off with empty seats. Some passengers lacked the proper documentation, and others did not show up, Dr. Braden said. In the end, around 200 passengers were evacuated, not the expected 240, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t even know what to say to those numbers,” said Jiacheng Yu of Dallas, whose mother, Ying Cheng, a 61-year-old American citizen, was visiting her own mother in Wuhan for the Lunar New Year and could not get a seat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When asked whether other flights were planned, a State Department official said its embassy in Beijing “continues to work with the Chinese authorities on other options for U.S. citizens in Wuhan to depart Wuhan and/or China.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At least one American chose not to try to board Wednesday’s flight. Winifred Conrad, a 27-year-old English teacher, had a lingering cough and was afraid she would instead be handed over to Chinese officials, said her mother, Anastasia Coles of Lubbock, Texas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there was another reason: Ms. Conrad’s cat, Lulu.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In text message to her mother, she said: “Don’t freak out. I was offered a seat and I surrendered it to a 10-year-old girl.” She added, “I was told I can’t bring an animal.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of confirmed cases in China increased by nearly 30 percent from Wednesday to Thursday, according to the country’s National Health Commission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese health authorities said Thursday that 170 people had died from the virus in the country. The previous count, on Wednesday, was 132.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei, the home of province of Wuhan, said Wednesday evening that the fight against the virus was at a crucial point, and that medical supplies were severely insufficient.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As cases emerged outside China, some appeared to involve infections between family members, who are at greater risk while caring for sick relatives. Others, however, appear to have spread between people with less intimate connections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A Japanese tour bus driver in his 60s who had driven two tour groups visiting Japan from Wuhan was confirmed to have the virus, officials said on Tuesday. He had no history of traveling to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think what that says is, if we can get transmission in such a setting, then we can certainly get it in the waiting room of a clinic or a hospital,” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. “That’s very concerning.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, German officials said a 33-year-old man from Starnberg, a town near Munich, was apparently infected with the virus after attending a training event with a Chinese colleague on Jan. 21. The colleague flew home two days later. The German man was being treated in isolation and officials were tracing people who had been in contact with him.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Late Tuesday, health officials in Germany said three more people from the same company had also been infected. They were admitted to a clinic in Munich, where they, too, were to be isolated. Forty other people who came into close contact with the company employees were to be tested on Wednesday, officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak and the travel restrictions it has led to have already had a big impact on businesses, some of which are temporarily halting operations in parts of China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks, for example, said it was temporarily closing half of its stores in the country. Closing were also announced by McDonald’s and Yum China, which operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And Apple said the outbreak could disrupt suppliers and its revenues.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Miriam Jordan reported from Los Angeles, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong.

Davis Lin and Mike Benoist</h3>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s Thursday, January 30.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well, we started hearing reports in early January that there was this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in central China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a mystery virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">People were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which scientists were calling a coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead to pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals, things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty small problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been infected and that, of those, only about four had died.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was treatable and that things would be O.K.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was happening.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations like this?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000 people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it comes to public health.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they needed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so what do you do?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks, enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Once I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him because he was challenging the official narrative about what was happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what was happening to his posts once they went online?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did he tell you?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions, that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">This is the moment when the world begins to wake up.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">That are doing surveillance.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It is. It’s growing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The number of people who have died —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll climbing once again overnight.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">26 deaths so far from the —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— has now passed 40.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yeah.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Are you anxious?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">I mean, understandably.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And then the very next day, I hear —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">What do you mean?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Why?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, thank you.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thanks, Michael.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"> That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The cancellations are just one sign of rising anxiety across the city over the coronavirus. In recent days, for instance, the sight of people wearing surgical masks in the subway has become more common. Around the city, some students have shown up to school wearing masks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">City health officials have urged New Yorkers to go about their lives. They say there is no reason for healthy people to shy away from public gatherings — even those who recently returned from Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">How Is the U.S. Being Affected?</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb.10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This week, health officials across New York have sent samples — taken by means of an oral swab, nasal swab and by asking the patient to spit — from at least 10 people to the C.D.C. in Atlanta to be tested for the virus. The results that have come back have all been negative. A few were still pending as of the last update.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some people on the last direct flights from Wuhan to Kennedy International Airport — before they were canceled last week — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus.html" title="">have been in self-imposed quarantine</a> at their homes, limiting their contact with their own families.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html" title="">With more than 6,000 confirmed cases of the virus in China</a>, many local Chinese-American civic and cultural leaders fear that their community will be blamed or face stigma should the illness land in New York.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think the Chinese community also doesn’t want to be scapegoated,” said Amy Chin, a genealogist and cultural activist. “Those of us who know our history, there is a sensitivity.” Ms. Chin was referring to a quarantine of San Francisco’s Chinatown <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/health/measles-outbreak-vaccinations-brooklyn.html" title="">more than a century ago</a> amid fears over the plague.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Chin recalled how in 2003, fear over SARS, another coronavirus, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/10/nyregion/fear-not-sars-rattles-south-jersey-school.html" title="">led a New Jersey school </a>to cancel a Chinese cultural program amid concerns from parents that the dancers performing at the event might have the illness.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is a lot of anxiety about how we need to work together as a community, and that we need to lower the risk,” said Ya Yun Teng, who was involved in organizing the canceled Temple Bazaar event in Flushing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This weekend, Wu Hongguang, chairman of the Wenzhou Association, canceled his group’s Lunar New Year celebration at the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/RoyalQueenNY/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Royal Queen</a> restaurant in Flushing because of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re afraid!” Mr. Wu exclaimed, in Mandarin, from the association’s headquarters on Northern Boulevard. “A lot of our members are older and we’re afraid many could get sick.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Royal Queen is a spacious banquet hall — located on the top floor of the New World Mall in the center of Flushing — that can accommodate more than a thousand people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On any given evening in the days surrounding the Lunar New Year it’s usually packed with Chinese revelers from large associations. There are festive scenes, sumptuous platters of Chinese delicacies, and the clanking of plates and glasses over the din of people shouting out their toasts and well wishes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the scene was different on Tuesday night. The escalator led onto a floor of empty banquet tables.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The manager, Connie Zhang, sat at a table against the wall. Ms. Zhang acknowledged that there were many cancellations. She had returned all the deposits that groups had paid to secure the space.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, she said, weddings were still being booked.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can’t cancel weddings,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At SkyFoods, a Chinese supermarket on Main Street in Flushing, Mark Zhao, 36, the night manager, said the store had planned to hold their annual New Year’s celebration on Tuesday. As always, they had invited wholesalers, management and members of the staff from both of the store’s locations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But last week they canceled the event, which was supposed to be at the Royal Queen. Hundreds were expected to attend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We couldn’t go on and have a party while there is still so much happening in China,” Mr. Zhao, who was wearing a mask, said in Mandarin. “At least for now.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added: “When things start to settle down we’ll consider it. Maybe next month.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Councilman Peter Koo, who attends many of these events every year, said he understood the concern since the parties are large and people often end up sitting with people they don’t know. But he urged caution.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t want people to be overly alarmed because there are no confirmed cases,” he said. “We just want everybody to be careful and practice basic hygiene — wash your hands and sneeze into your elbows — and don’t believe everything you see on social media, including Chinese social media. There’s a lot that’s inaccurate.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the many cancellations, several high-profile Lunar New Year events have occurred as planned. Flushing’s largest Lunar New Year parade happened this past weekend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People are tough,” said John Choe, the executive director of the Greater Flushing Chamber of Commerce. “We are going to keep doing what we do.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He acknowledged that parade turnout was lower this year, but noted that it had rained. “There was lower attendance,” he said, “but we don’t know if it was rain or fear of coronavirus.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Davis Lin and Mike Benoist</h3>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s Thursday, January 30.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well, we started hearing reports in early January that there was this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in central China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a mystery virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">People were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which scientists were calling a coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead to pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals, things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty small problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been infected and that, of those, only about four had died.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was treatable and that things would be O.K.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was happening.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations like this?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000 people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it comes to public health.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they needed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so what do you do?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks, enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Once I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him because he was challenging the official narrative about what was happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what was happening to his posts once they went online?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did he tell you?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions, that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">This is the moment when the world begins to wake up.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">That are doing surveillance.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It is. It’s growing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The number of people who have died —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll climbing once again overnight.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">26 deaths so far from the —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— has now passed 40.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yeah.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Are you anxious?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">I mean, understandably.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And then the very next day, I hear —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">What do you mean?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Why?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, thank you.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thanks, Michael.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"> That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014, when a few cases turned up in the United States, some hospitals were unable to get waterproof Tyvek suits “because there was a run on them,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Panicked people engage in irrational impulse buying, he said: “People like to buy duct tape during emergencies — it’s psychologically soothing.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But artificial shortages can harm those who really need the goods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think public health authorities like the H.H.S. or the C.D.C. or the Surgeon General should be talking about the repercussions of a run on masks,” Dr. Adalja said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kristen Nordlund, a C.D.C. spokeswoman, said she would ask <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/ncird.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dr. Nancy Messonnier</a>, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases to address that issue in her next public briefing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masks are part of the medical equipment stored in the National Strategic Stockpile, which is distributed in government-controlled warehouses around the country. But experts said they did not know how many were in storage or how long the supply was projected to last in an epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, major pharmacy chains said they were seeing spot shortages but were not yet restricting sales. The CVS chain had stores running out of masks and was resupplying them “as quickly as possible,” said Stephanie Cunha, a company spokeswoman.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Walgreens and Duane Reade pharmacies saw greater demand for face masks and hand sanitizer in many stores, said Alexandra Brown, a spokeswoman for the Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns both chains.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company is moving supplies “to meet the needs of our customers,” she added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masks are not very protective when worn by healthy people, experts say. People often pull them aside for a variety of reasons.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Vapor from breath can leave masks soggy, for example. Users may want to talk on their cellphones, or put their fingers under their masks to scratch their noses. Frequent handwashing is considered more protective.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet there is strong evidence that masks protect health workers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trials in Canadian hospitals during <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322898/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the 2003 SARS epidemic </a>and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/184819" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">during flu season</a> showed that nurses who wore a mask were less likely to get flu.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nurses who wore N-95 masks — which are thicker, fit tighter to the face and are designed to filter out 95 percent of all particles — were particularly protective for those who did dangerous procedures like intubating SARS patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is less data proving that masks keep patients from spreading germs. But this common sense notion has led many hospitals to adopt rules saying that any emergency room patient with flu symptoms is immediately handed a mask and asked to put it on.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious disease specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who led the SARS and flu trials, said one <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/12/e012330.long" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">relatively small study of hospitalized flu patients in Beijing</a> found that mask-wearers were less likely to infect their family members. But the effect was so small that it was considered statistically insignificant.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another obstacle to mask-wearing is psychological.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People who are sick and should be wearing a mask are often reluctant to do so, because it makes them stand out in the crowd. Unless these patients are ordered to wear one — as they might be in a hospital emergency room — people are reluctant to do so.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When masks aren’t common in a culture, it does raise eyebrows,” Dr. Adalja said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The exceptions are in some Asian communities, where it is common for people to wear masks to protect themselves against germs and pollution, or because it is considered impolite to not wear a mask if one is coughing or sneezing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts, including Dr. Patel of the C.D.C., said they knew of no studies of the psychology of mask usage or how reluctance could be overcome.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Mike spoke with Chris by phone.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What is it like with these unprecedented restrictions in place?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It may be difficult to envisage just how thoroughly people have retreated from the streets and from public life. I had to cross one of the big bridges across the Yangtze for my reporting. And there I was, on one of these Chinese share bikes that are everywhere, on an almost completely empty bridge, spanning one of China’s biggest cities, crossing its biggest river. And there were just two other people on the bridge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A lot of people wonder how long the shutdown can last. Even now people are worrying about the jobs they may lose, the businesses that will close, the school semesters that they might miss.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">You’ve reported that </strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus-social-media.html" title="">the anger on Chinese social media</a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> is intense.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, and you hear that here as well.

First of all, there’s a natural wariness about getting close to anybody. But once you reassure them — you’re outside, at a distance of a good 10 feet — they can be very open and also very generous.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">How does that compare to the response you normally get?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reaction you get as a foreign reporter varies quite a bit across China.

But Apple is girding for more disruptions in virus-hit China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple Inc on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, thanks to rising iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The performance outweighed concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market and manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company's services business, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares of Apple rose 2% in after-hours trade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple forecasted revenue for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company used a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week," he said. "The situation is emerging, and we’re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10, Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple has shut one store in China, he said, and reduced hours at others because of lower foot traffic, Cook said. Third-party stores that sell Apple products are also facing some closures, Cook said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple is "forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast," said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SERVICES MISS BUT GROWING</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called Apple's installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year. Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple’s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple posted $91.8 billion (69.8 billion pounds) in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple has made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. Services revenue was $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Services are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel they’ve made good progress on that front," said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The shift towards services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a "rousing success" and that it is "very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device." </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IPhone sales of $55.96 billion beat analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion, snapping a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple’s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices "the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Apple’s wearables segment – which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch – hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both.

"Weak and poorly managed airlines will suffer."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Margins at many carriers remain narrow, economic growth has been fragile amid a U.S.-China trade war and there are fears that the return of the 737 MAX, expected mid-year, could lead to overcapacity and push down fares. Airbus and Boeing orders have fallen from the peak levels of 2013 and 2014.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The epidemic is particularly concerning to the industry because China is the world's biggest outbound international travel market and the second-largest domestic aviation market. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> The country accounts for about 25% of global sales for airplane manufacturers Airbus SE and Boeing Co. About 450 million more passengers fly to, from and within China per year compared with a decade ago, according to IATA.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Chinese airlines, the biggest of which are state-backed, the impact of the new coronavirus has been swift. On Wednesday, 23% of departures from Shanghai Hongqiao airport had been cancelled, according to FlightRadar24, compared with 8% at the more internationally focused Shanghai Pudong airport.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Overall, almost 9% of Chinese domestic and international flights did not take off as scheduled from Jan. 23 to 27, according to Cirium aviation data reflecting aircraft movements and official cancellations. Besides Wuhan, the worst-affected airports were Beijing, Ghangzhou and Shanghai.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mike Boyd, head of U.S.-based aviation consultancy Boyd Group International, said he had forecast airport traffic in China to rise 8.1% in 2020 but now sees traffic growing at less than half that rate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It is a real slam," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cathay Pacific, already battered by a fall in demand because of anti-government protests in its home market of Hong Kong, said on Tuesday evening it would cut flights to mainland China by 50% or more through the end of March.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fate of Cathay and local rival Hong Kong Airlines could depend on the willingness of travellers to transit through Hong Kong airport, BOCOM International analyst Luya You said. The protests have already led to a collapse in demand from mainland tourists and business travellers, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asian jet fuel prices have dropped and refiners' profits for the product have slumped to their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years over concerns that the coronavirus will hurt demand, although that will also help unhedged carriers keep a lid on costs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">U.S. and European carriers have less relative exposure than their Asian rivals. Chinese carriers dominate airline travel between China and long-haul destinations. But they were racking up international losses even before the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Flights to China account for 2%-6% of estimated revenue at United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and Air Canada, according to analysts at Cowen, an independent investment bank, although they added there were concerns the virus would not be contained in China given how it was spreading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the Europeans, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have the most to lose in a China traffic slump, and the Franco-Dutch airline group has so far maintained flights to Beijing and Shanghai. Both groups rely on China for 7% of their capacity, according to UBS data, compared with 3% for BA parent IAG.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Historically, air traffic has returned to normal after health scares. In the case of SARS, it took nine months to recover, according to IATA.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It (SARS) meant we did cut back on some international capacity but it rebounded very fast," Qantas Airways Ltd Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters on Wednesday, saying that earnings took a A$55 million ($37.61 million) hit from that epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We do now have a lot of experience over the years with MERS, with Zika virus, with volcanoes, with all sorts of activity that's impacted the airlines," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> ($1 = 1.4622 Australian dollars)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Jamie Freed in Sydney and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago; Additional reporting by Laurence Frost in Paris; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Hugh Lawson)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

I had to cross one of the big bridges across the Yangtze for my reporting. And there I was, on one of these Chinese share bikes that are everywhere, on an almost completely empty bridge, spanning one of China’s biggest cities, crossing its biggest river. And there were just two other people on the bridge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A lot of people wonder how long the shutdown can last.

People erupt with a kind of anger and exasperation over how it was that this dangerous pathogen was among them but they didn’t understand, in many cases, how serious it was or what was going on until the city was shut down.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But that’s leavened by a sense among many people that the most pressing thing is to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ChuBailiang/status/1222050019835969536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">get through this crisis </a>— so that as few people die as possible and life can return to a kind of normality as soon as possible.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What else are you seeing there?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You see a combination of reactions when you approach people to talk. First of all, there’s a natural wariness about getting close to anybody. But once you reassure them — you’re outside, at a distance of a good 10 feet — they can be very open and also very generous.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">How does that compare to the response you normally get?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reaction you get as a foreign reporter varies quite a bit across China.

Exports fell 5.2% in December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There were 21.5 working days in January this year because of the Lunar New Year holiday from Jan. 24 to 27, providing the month with 2.5 fewer working days than last year. The holiday fell in early February last year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond the calendar effect expected in January's data, however, most economists see exports growth turning positive in February amid signs of recovery in chip sales and Chinese demand.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The decline in exports will likely widen in January from the previous month on fewer working days, but the export growth will turn positive in February due to opposite base effect," said Park Sung-woo, economist at DB Financial Investment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Preliminary data showed South Korea's exports in the first 20 days of January fell 0.2% from a year earlier, marking the smallest decline in a year, on better chip sales.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But analysts see the contagious virus possibly piling more pressure on the trade-reliant economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus, originating in the Chinese central city of Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to the United States, Japan, Canada, France and Germany among others. It has killed more than 100 people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Though we expect exports growth to turn positive in February, the rebound is unlikely to be strong given the possibility of a temporary slowdown in Chinese demand over the virus," said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment &amp; Securities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The development of the virus will serve as an important variable for recovery in South Korea's exports going further," Park added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, South Korea's finance minister vowed to stabilise financial markets should market volatility worsen, adding that the outbreak may hit the nation's exports and economic growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the same poll, 11 economists separately expect South Korea's consumer prices to rise a median 1.1% in January on-year, faster than a 0.7% gain in December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists also saw industrial output in December rising a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from a month earlier.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Industrial output and trade data are due to be released on Friday and Saturday, respectively, while inflation data will be out on Feb. 4.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Joori Roh; Editing by Sam Holmes)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Zhang said it could weigh on jobs, with the official survey-based unemployment rate likely to exceed 5.3% in the coming months, Zhang said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In response, the government is likely to step up policy support, which could boost the annual budget deficit as a share of GDP to over 3% in 2020, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The People's Bank of China could further cut banks' reserve requirement ratios and interest rates, Zhang added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economic growth could recover later this year, bringing the full-year expansion to 5.7%, Zhang said. In 2019 growth was 6.1%, the weakest in 29 years.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaking before the start of the outbreak, policy sources told Reuters that Beijing planned to set a lower national growth target of around 6% this year from last year's 6-6.5%, relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Kevin Yao; editing by John Stonestreet)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

And now, the travel industry is more reliant on Chinese travellers, and China's share of the global economy has quadrupled. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"This year, the impact on jet fuel could be more severe, as China's share of global jet demand has risen from 3.8% in 2003 to 12% in 2017," Citi analysts led by Ed Morse said in a note. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If air passenger traffic in China were to decline by half in the first quarter of this year, it would likely lead to a 300,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) decline in jet kerosene demand from China from a year ago, Barclays analyst Singh said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several airlines across Asia have suspended flights to Wuhan, and some tour operators are cancelling trips to China.

The team was placed in isolation by border officials after arriving in Brisbane from Shanghai on Tuesday, and will be confined to a Brisbane hotel until Feb. 5.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Queensland Health said the squad was traveling with a team doctor and none has shown symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Olympic regional qualifying tournament had been relocated from Wuhan to Nanjing before the Asian Football Confederation moved it to Sydney, Australia, because of concerns over the deadly coronavirus.

As the World Health Organization declared last week, it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">remains too early</a> to call the outbreak a global public health emergency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, the Wuhan coronavirus is not much more frightening than the outbreaks of other recent coronaviruses like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">SARS in 2003</a> or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">MERS in 2012</a>, each of which killed fewer than a thousand people around the world. The new virus’s death toll has just exceeded 130; for context, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the CDC</a>, about 15 million Americans have been sickened by the seasonal flu so far in the 2019-2020 flu season, and 8,200 have died from it.

It’s not just that many people get their news from a medium given to rumor, exaggeration and wild misinformation, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.118.011838" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">especially on issues about health or science</a> — see the persistence of antivaxers or climate-change deniers.

From Donald Trump to Xi Jinping to Boris Johnson, strongmen with authoritarian tendencies run many of the world’s most powerful governments. It is worth remembering that disease, or the fear of disease, can bring out the worst in humanity — pandemics often <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/health/01plague.html" title="">feed scapegoating</a> (Jews were widely blamed for the Black Death), creating a fertile field for demagogues. When you put all these factors together, you’ve got a dangerous recipe for global repression.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Already, China’s response appears to be driven by political considerations more than epidemiological ones. The government has imposed a travel lockdown on more than 35 million people, which experts say is a quarantine of unprecedented size and scale, yet <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/opinion/china-wuhan-virus-quarantine.html" title="">it may not even turn out to be very effective</a>. Experts say that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">quarantines work best during the earliest stages</a> of an outbreak, but that they can also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2267247/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">backfire</a>, causing medical shortages, corroding trust in health officials and pushing some people to look to evade care to escape any restriction on their rights. China took weeks to mount a full-scale response to the virus. According to Wuhan’s mayor, five<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047720/chinese-premier-li-keqiang-head-coronavirus-crisis-team-outbreak" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> million people left the city before restrictions were imposed</a>, suggesting the country is effectively locking the barn door after the horse has run off.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They’re doing it because people who are in political leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that you’ll gain popular support,” Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/unprecedented-chinese-quarantine-could-backfire-experts-say/2020/01/24/db073f3c-3ea4-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told The Washington Post</a>. “They couldn’t have any sound public health advice.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We should keep this sense of caution in mind in case American politicians begin pushing for travel bans, overbroad quarantines or other measures that might not be supported by the science.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You might wonder what the great harm is — if the government needs to temporarily limit people’s movements or prevent some people from entering the country, shouldn’t it take those measures in the face of dangerous illness? Perhaps, but given the checkered history of quarantines — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559034/pdf/12-0312.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">throughout history,</a> they have been used to persecute the marginalized — lawmakers and the media should rigorously examine the bases for any such restrictions. We should especially make sure any restrictions imposed are indeed temporary and adhere to the science — something <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/medical-and-genetic-privacy/fear-politics-and-ebola" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">we don’t always do</a>. Consider that 30 years after the AIDS outbreak, men who have sex with men are still restricted from donating blood in the United States, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554671/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">long after the scientific basis for such a ban has passed</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, President Trump has offered a measured response to the virus. “We have it totally under control,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/22/trump-chinese-coronavirus-totally-under-control-102054" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he said this week</a>.

The Americas region accounted for about 40% of Treasury's annual revenue in financial year 2019.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement, Treasury said it now expects its core earnings to grow about 5-10% for 2020, compared with an earlier range of 15% to 20%.

The change came after McPherson notified the company he was unable to relocate to the United States as planned due to unforeseen personal circumstances.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Management said during the call that its guidance did not take into account any potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China, as it would be "premature" to do so at this point of time. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Deep discounting had been an issue for Treasury in 2014, when outgoing CEO Michael Clarke was brought in to rethink the company's strategy and tasked with turning around fortunes after strained profits and a troubled foray into the U.S. wine market.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Clarke has since then led the company through a phase of rapid growth in China, and a major acquisition of the U.S. assets of the world's largest spirits group Diageo Plc </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company had also warned that drought, heat and fires in Australia could drive up the cost of its 2020 Australian vintage wine, which is currently in harvest.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Treasury's vineyards remained unscathed from Australia's monster fires, some of its suppliers in the Adelaide Hills were not so lucky.

They were happy to be here. They were very cooperative with the questions," Braden told a news conference at the Riverside University Health System Medical Center, near the base. "They want to protect themselves. They want to protect others."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">NO ONE SHOWED SYMPTOMS</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. evacuees, who underwent another round of screening on arrival in California, will be given further medical evaluations, including a blood test for exposure to the virus, over the next three days, the officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">None of the arriving passengers has so far exhibited any signs of illness such as fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms, the officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The screening in Alaska included a questionnaire to check for factors that would deem them to have been at high risk of infection, including exposure to someone diagnosed with coronavirus or close contact to someone living with a person who was sick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"There were no individuals who responded to the questions indicating they were high-risk," said Dr. Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection. "We are reassessing that now."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One individual on the original evacuation manifest was barred from boarding the plane in China because the person had a fever. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The State Department ordered its personnel evacuated from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan and welcomed other American citizens onto the flight because there was excess room on the plane, CDC officials said. The group included an unspecified number of children, ranging from a month-old infant to teenagers, they said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The plan is to allow the evacuees to return to their homes once the initial evaluation period is over, provided there is no indication of exposure or illness, the officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At that point, absent any symptoms or a positive test result, an individual would be considered non-infectious and be permitted to travel on public transportation without putting others at risk, Braden said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">FREE TO LEAVE?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People who may be incubating the infection before any symptoms appear are not believed to be contagious, Braden said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health authorities will continue "active monitoring" of all the passengers through the end of a 14-day incubation period, and plans are in place to isolate any individual who shows signs of illness after going home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If any evacuees test positive or fall ill in the next three days, they would be transferred to the Riverside Medical Center for isolation and treatment, and authorities would decide what measures need to be taken for the rest of the group, Braden said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked if someone in the group who tested negative before the 72-hour hold was over would be free to leave the base early, Knight said that would lead to a conversation that "would be discussed up to the highest levels within the U.S. government."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"If we think a person is a danger to the community, we can institute an individual quarantine for that person, and we will," Braden added.

Treasury ruled out an exit from the U.S. market.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Treasury in December announced the appointment of Ben Dollard as president of its operations in the Americas, replacing Angus McPherson. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The change came after McPherson notified the company he was unable to relocate to the United States as planned due to unforeseen personal circumstances.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Deep discounting had been an issue for Treasury in 2014, when outgoing CEO Michael Clarke was brought in to rethink the company's strategy and tasked with turning around fortunes after troubles in the U.S. wine market.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Clarke has since then led the company through a phase of rapid growth in China, and a major acquisition of the U.S. assets of the world's largest spirits group Diageo Plc in 2016.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It is perhaps no surprise that the profit weakness was in the Americas business," said Nigel Stevenson an analyst at GMT Research, which in August said Treasury may have inflated profits following its purchase of most of Diageo's wine business.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">   </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Hong Kong-based research house last year argued Treasury might have used acquisition accounting to boost profits by about A$300 million (155.96 million pounds), which the company rejected.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">    </span>"Profitability in the Americas business may now be declining to more normal levels as the benefits of the acquisition wind down," Stevenson told Reuters in emailed remarks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Treasury also warned drought, heat and fires in Australia could drive up the cost of its 2020 Australian vintage wine, which is currently in harvest.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Shriya Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Lincoln Feast.)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

However, he acknowledged Emirati officials now were tracing the family's steps since landing in this federation of seven sheikhdoms that includes Dubai and Abu Dhabi. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Their condition is stable, they are awake, they are all receiving all the measures,” al-Rand said. “I would say to the public: Please, don't be panicked. The health condition within the United Arab Emirates is safe.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among those sick in the family are a grandmother, her daughter, the daughter's husband and the couple's 9-year-old daughter, al-Rand said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The family from Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak, entered the UAE on Jan. 16, al-Rand said. He declined to name the airline the family flew on and the airport at which they arrived. The UAE is home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways and is a hub for global air travel. Al-Rand also declined to say which cities they visited during their vacation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Authorities at Abu Dhabi's airport and Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, began screening passengers and crew from incoming China flights on Jan. 23. That's the day China shut down Wuhan's airport and other transportation in the city to stop the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since expanded to include 17 cities with more than 50 million people in all.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That same day, Jan. 23, the grandmother among the family fell ill and sought medical care, al-Rand said. Public awareness about the virus had spread widely and doctors tested the grandmother for the new coronavirus and got a positive result. Authorities admitted the other three shortly after and they too tested positive. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, six days after the grandmother fell ill, the UAE announced the cases, initially providing little information. They later confirmed the number of those ill and their nationality. The World Health Organization, which is keeping track of those who fall ill from the new virus, reported the four cases in the UAE late Wednesday night. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Emirati officials are taking "all the necessary precautions in accordance with the scientific recommendations, conditions and standards approved by the World Health Organization," the Health and Prevention Ministry said. “The general health condition is not a cause for concern."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">State-run and government-supporting media in the UAE carefully announced the news Wednesday, stressing that authorities said they had the situation under control. However, reports quickly emerged of face masks selling out at pharmacies as a popular online retailer had them as a top trending item.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At Arab Health, a major trade show happening this week in Dubai, a few Emiratis and others attending wore surgical masks while walking among the crowds. A few tourists also wore face masks while visiting sites in Dubai.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Al-Rand declined to name the Emirati hospital the four now are receiving treatment. He also declined to say how many people Emirati health authorities had contacted while tracing the family's travel in the UAE.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Emirates meanwhile said it continued its flights to Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are providing masks and hand sanitisers to all crew on our flights to China,” the company said in a statement. “Our crew who serve passengers with any symptoms have been advised to wear masks onboard.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new type of coronavirus first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December. It causes flu-like symptoms, such as cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, that are similar to many other illnesses. It's from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 6,000 people in the mainland and more than a dozen other countries. China's death toll has passed 130. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several countries have confirmed cases of the virus, with most of them being Chinese visitors, people who visited Wuhan or family members in close contact with the sick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The source of the virus and the full extent of its spread are still unknown. However, the WHO said most cases reported to date “have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facing lower oil prices and a slumping housing market, the UAE has been aggressively pursuing more Chinese tourists to this country home to the world's tallest building. Chinese visitors to the country can get visas on arrival to the UAE. Malls in Dubai now have Chinese on their signs alongside Arabic and English, with tour groups tramping through and high-end shoppers targeting luxury stores. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dubai alone welcomed 989,000 tourists from China in 2019, up 15% from 857,000 in 2018, according to the city-state's tourism department.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Associated Press writers Fay Abuelgasim and Kamran Jebreili in Dubai contributed to this report. </p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

It suspended all business trips to and from China for at least two weeks and closed its Stockdorf plant until Feb. 2.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SANGUINE MOOD</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One Webasto employee, who declined to give his name but said he was 54 and lived nearby, came out of the building headed for his car.

An inverted yield curve has historically been an indicator of looming recession as it tends to reflect worries over future growth among bond investors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">However, worries about the coronavirus have so far done little to shake the upbeat growth views many investors and analysts had going into 2020. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The state of the U.S. economy seems to be steady as she goes,” said Michael Lorizio, senior fixed income trader at Manulife Asset Management. “To really forecast any chance of near-term recession I think I’d need to see more fundamental support from economic indicators, not just relying on the yield curve.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Various portions of the Treasury yield curve inverted in 2019 for the first time in years, sparking concerns that a recession may be looming. Some of those worries faded after the Federal Reserve delivered three rate cuts and said it is unlikely to tighten monetary policy in the near future, buoying prices for stocks and boosting investor bullishness: a recent UBS Global Wealth Management survey of high-net worth investors showed that 94% expected positive returns in 2020, while a fund manager poll from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed stock allocations at their highest level in 17 months. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tuesday’s brief inversion came as investors rushed back into Treasuries and other haven assets, sending U.S. government bond prices higher and pushing down yields. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The very front of the curve remained kinked, with bills yielding more than shorter-dated notes like 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year maturities. However, those relationships are not as closely monitored as economic bellwethers. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"You have the feeling of a fragile global economy that is relying on support from central banks and a situation where lots of risky assets appear... moderately overvalued," said Thanos Bardas, global co-head investment grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">U.S. stock markets were on track to erase most of the previous day’s losses Tuesday after falling to a two-week low a day before. But investors remain concerned over how severe travel restrictions and other measures to contain the virus will impact China’s economy and ripple through the rest of the world. China’s economy - the world’s second largest - is already expected to expand at its slowest pace in three decades this year, a Reuters poll found earlier this month. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some are also grappling with contradictory signals over growth in the United States.

The outbreak of the new flu-like virus in China has led to fears of a further slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After ticking off a list of positive developments, including the initial trade agreement reached recently by the United States and China and some indication a slip in global manufacturing has hit bottom, Powell noted China's economy would see at least a short-term hit from the coronavirus outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We are very carefully monitoring the situation," Powell told reporters, adding that while the implications of the outbreak for China's output are clear, it is "too early" to determine its global effect or impact on the U.S. economic outlook.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed's statement, calling out solid job gains and low unemployment, was little changed from the one issued after its December meeting.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The Fed’s going to remain on hold for the foreseeable future, as long as GDP growth and inflation doesn’t move outside of the bands that we’re stuck in, anchored right around 2%," said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed's statement did not announce any immediate changes to the central bank's current practice of buying $60 billion monthly of U.S. Treasury bills to ensure adequate short-term liquidity in bank funding markets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Powell said the Fed would likely begin scaling back that amount sometime in the April-June period, when the amount of reserves in the banking system would likely be deemed adequate. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After that, purchases would be made and the Fed's balance sheet expanded as necessary to ensure the level of bank reserves remained "ample," he said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fed policymakers have been discussing how and when to end the temporary Treasury bill purchases, which have been underway since October, and what sort of permanent replacement it could use to ensure the central bank keeps control of the federal funds rate. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yields on U.S. Treasury securities ground lower as Powell spoke, while benchmark U.S. stock market indexes gave up most of their gains on the day. The dollar was largely flat against a basket of major trading partner currencies. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a related decision, the Fed raised the interest it pays banks for excess reserves by five basis points to 1.60%, a technical adjustment officials say was needed to keep the federal funds rate around the middle of the target range.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The interest rate decision was widely expected, with recent economic data showing the economy on track for continued growth, and no sign inflation is rising so fast that it poses a risk the Fed might need to counter with higher borrowing costs to slow the economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The vote was unanimous. That implies that the Fed is going to stay on hold here," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "Of course, they always leave the door open."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed cut rates last year to bolster an economy buffeted by trade wars, and has set a high bar for any further rate changes. Powell has said a "material reassessment" of the economic outlook would be required for any shift. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed's assessment of household spending was marked down slightly from a "strong pace" in its December statement to a "moderate" pace.

All five patients, being treated at two Tokyo hospitals, were stable, hospital officials said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later Wednesday, seven other evacuees who cleared an earlier screening on board were also found to have coughs and fever in a secondary screening and were hospitalized, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said in a statement. The remaining evacuees who had no symptoms were taken to a hotel where they will be quarantined.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan's government sent a chartered flight to pick up the evacuees, most of whom resided close to the Wuhan seafood market linked to the first cases of the new virus that has infected thousands. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly when we were still in the city,” Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.'s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda airport while he waited for a bus to take him to a hospital for another health check. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My uneasiness peaked when the number of patients started to spike,” he said, wearing a mask that muffled his voice. “I fell asleep as soon as I sat down on my seat (on the plane),” he said. Other evacuees seated near him also seemed relieved but tired.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan has eight confirmed cases, including what could be the country's first human-to-human infections, a tour bus driver who served two groups of Chinese tourists from Wuhan on Jan. 8-16, and a tour guide who worked on the same bus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials said about 650 Japanese citizens and their families in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hebei province had sought to return home. Aoyama said there are more than 400 others still in Wuhan, including those working for a Japanese supermarket chain that has stayed open to serve customers who need food and other necessities and supplies. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said it was important to step up preventive measures in Japan, but “I hope we can also provide support for the Chinese people, while we also help Japanese people who are still there.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another evacuee, Takayuki Kato, said that all those wishing to leave Wuhan had submitted their health inquiry form and had their temperature taken before departure.

This is down from 882,000 bpd last year, according to China customs data.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The oil will feed Sinopec Corp's greenfield 200,000-bpd plant in Zhanjiang, Sinochem's 60,000-bpd expansion facility in Quanzhou, and the 200,000-bpd crude unit of privately-led Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp which started operations in Zhoushan last December.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(Graphic: China's refining capacity &amp; crude oil throughput - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8233/8214/China's%20refining%20capacity%20vs%20throughput.png)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Increased purchases will be a boon for exporters like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United States, which is looking to boost energy product sales to China as part of Phase 1 of the trade deal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last month's Phase 1 pact means China needs to boost buying of U.S. oil, which is mainly light and of low-sulphur, but as the new plants are geared towards processing medium high-sulphur grades, importers will have to find a balance between their refining needs and Beijing's imperatives.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Political fiat rather than market mechanisms will dictate flows," said Michal Meidan, director of the China energy programme at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Baseloads for the new refineries are mainly Middle Eastern grades so U.S. flows will likely push out West African or North Sea oil (of similar quality)," she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">JET FUEL FLOWS</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts expect China's exports of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel combined to maintain double-digit growth in 2020.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aviation fuel is set to lead exports with a 20% increase, due to faster expansion in domestic production versus declining demand growth, said Wang Yanting, Shandong-based analyst at consultancy JCL Network Technology.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Curbs on air travel amid fears of a new coronavirus epidemic will further dampen jet fuel consumption, which an executive with China National Aviation Fuel Company told Reuters grew at 6.2% last year, down from 7% in 2018. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We were forecasting growth at 6% this year (before the virus outbreak). It could only be lower," said the executive. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Exports of diesel and gasoline, however, will be capped as refiners shift production to make cleaner marine fuels to meet new international emission standards that came into force this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Refiners will divert more vacuum gas oil, the main feedstock for the production of very low sulphur fuel oil, to marine fuel, reducing diesel or gasoline output depending on plant configuration, refinery officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gasoline exports are still seen growing strongly, however, after surging 27% last year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(Graphic: China's refined oil products output vs exports - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8234/8215/China's%20refined%20oil%20products%20output%20vs%20exports.png)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(Thia story corrects to read "she said", paragraph 15)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Chen Aizhu in Singapore and Muyu Xu in Beijing; editing by Richard Pullin)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Yet it also cautioned that it would “monitor” the world economy, which could be slowed by China’s coronavirus — a risk that Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned at the start of a news conference. Stock and bond markets have gyrated in the past week over fears about the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The central bank said it would hold short-term rates in a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, far below levels that have been typical during previous expansions. Powell and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stock prices rose modestly after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time. Bond yields were mostly unchanged.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed’s statement, which the 10 policymakers approved unanimously, was nearly identical to the one it issued after its December meeting, though it described consumer spending as rising at only a “moderate” rather than at a “strong” pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the winter holidays.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many economists and investors had hoped that U.S. and global growth would pick up this year, now that the U.S. and China have signed a preliminary trade deal that removed some tariffs on Chinese goods. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund said last week that low interest rates and reduced trade tensions would likely buoy the global economy over the next two years and help nurture steady if modest growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But China’s viral outbreak has injected fresh doubts into that outlook. The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy — the world’s second-largest — which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Major companies across the world have responded by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company’s suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Investors seem increasingly to believe that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates again later this year. The chances of a cut by September’s Fed meeting have risen to about 56%, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s FedWatch tool, up from 37% just a month ago.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the Fed will likely wait to see how last year’s rate cuts play out. Among other benefits, the cuts have helped drive down mortgage rates and led home buyers to bid up prices on a dwindling number of available properties. Home sales jumped in December and were nearly 11% higher than a year earlier.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since they last met in December, Fed officials have presented a nearly unified front in support of keeping rates unchanged, possibly for the rest of this year. That contrasts with last year, when both “hawks,” who tend to favor higher rates, and “doves,” who typically lean toward lower rates, occasionally dissented from the Fed's rate decisions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed’s decision came a day after President Donald Trump urged Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut rates in a tweet, arguing it would make U.S. interest rates “competitive with other Countries.” Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and Japan, which they — and most analysts — see as evidence of weak economies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most analysts think the Fed would be more willing to cut rates if there were clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown. Still, some Fed watchers say they foresee a rate cut by the summer or after November's elections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One reason for a potential future cut is that inflation remains chronically low. According to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, prices rose just 1.5% in November from a year earlier, below the central bank's 2% annual target. Since the Fed adopted that target in 2012, inflation has failed to consistently reach that high, to the surprise of the Fed and most economists.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the index typically rises when markets grow turbulent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The VIX ended Tuesday's session at 16.28, down 2.74 points from yesterday's three-month high.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In total, there were last about 331,000 contracts open on those calls, most of which were purchased around the same price, according to options analytics provider Trade Alert.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo, said the transaction resembles past moves by an enigmatic investor some market participants have dubbed “50 Cent,” known for purchasing large blocks of VIX options at prices near 50 cents. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A trader believed to be 50 Cent made similar big purchases last summer and in the months leading up to a market selloff in February 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to Trade Alert, the VIX calls traded as high as $1.15 on Monday, so in total they could have generated some $21 million in profit if the calls were sold. However, there was "no sign of liquidation," Trade Alert founder Henry Schwartz wrote. The calls were trading between 70 and 80 cents late Tuesday, as U.S. stock markets rebounded.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"They would basically need a much bigger market reaction to make any meaningful profit on those trades," Chintawongvanich said. The block trades are likely a portfolio hedge rather than a bet on a spike in volatility, he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday and Tuesday, at least one investor bought large blocks of March VIX calls, at 57.5 cents and 59 cents, which would require the index to reach 28 before they could be redeemed. Outside of those trades, it was not evident that investors are loading up on downside protection at this point.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"When the VIX stays below 17, that's pretty sedate," said Jim Carney, CEO of hedge fund Parplus Partners.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by April Joyner; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Lincoln Feast.)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

But Fed officials have indicated they still see more chance of the economy softening than strengthening. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here's what the Fed is keeping an eye on as 2020 progresses:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IF JOB GROWTH INDICATORS BECOME WORRISOME</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. economy has added more than 20 million jobs since emerging from recession in 2009, and the unemployment rate is currently near a 50-year low at 3.5%. The pace of job growth has been slowing, which is consistent with an economy in which untapped labor is becoming scarce. Fed officials expect that to happen. What would worry them is if not enough jobs are being created to keep up with U.S. population growth. Economists and Fed officials estimate that figure to be somewhere between 75,000 and 125,000 jobs a month on average. Another one to watch? A newer, more real-time economic indicator known as the "Sahm Rule" which posits that when the 3-month average jobless rate rises half a percentage point above the low of the previous 12 months, the economy is in recession, or near one.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graphic: Fed is watching job growth in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1570/1545/Pasted%20Image.jpg</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IF U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS BELOW 2%</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The economy grew 2.9% in 2018, but Fed officials forecast economic growth to be around 2.2% last year due to the fading impact of the Trump administration's tax-cut package and slowing global growth. The U.S. economy is currently growing around its potential, which economists put at between 1.7% and 2.0%. Fed officials have already said if it weakens beyond the trend pace, that could prompt another interest rate cut. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. economic activity, has held up well so far. If it shows signs of deteriorating, the Fed will pay attention.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graphic: Fed is watching GDP in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1571/1546/Pasted%20Image.jpg</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IF INFLATION HEADS THE WRONG WAY</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed has targeted a 2% inflation rate since 2012, but it consistently undershot that goal as the U.S. economy continued to recover from the last recession. For much of 2018, inflation was actually in the sweet spot of around 2%, only for it to drop back below that level this year. This matters to the Fed because the more that lower inflation expectations become engrained in people's minds, the more risk there is that price rises slow further. And while slower-rising prices might sound like a good thing, once inflation hits zero or below, as it has in Japan and Europe, it begins to slow spending and growth, as consumers put off purchases in the expectation prices might fall further. So if inflation moves further away from the 2% target on a sustained basis, the Fed could see a need to cut interest rates again in order to try and boost it. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graphic: Fed is watching inflation in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1569/1544/Pasted%20Image.jpg</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IF THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR RE-ESCALATES</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed was buffeted for much of 2019 by the economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's chaotic trade policy, in particular the U.S.-China trade war. The spillover from escalating tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest economies has caused a drop in U.S. business investment, and put U.S. manufacturing in recession. Neither has yet to recover, with manufacturing also hit by Boeing's suspension of production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some trade tensions have eased with the signing earlier this month of a "Phase 1" trade deal between Washington and Beijing, but U.S. President Donald Trump has simultaneously threatened Europe with more tariffs. Even if the U.S.-China trade truce holds, Trump's propensity to swiftly change his mind, particularly against the backdrop of a bid for re-election this year, will keep the Fed guessing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graphic: Fed is watching business investment in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1572/1547/Pasted%20Image.jpg</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IF THE YIELD CURVE INVERTS OR FUNDING STRESS EMERGES AGAIN</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One financial market indicator that several Fed officials fret about is the shape of the so-called "yield curve." When it inverts - effectively when short-term securities pay a higher rate of interest than longer-term ones - it suggests that investors expect a recession. In March, the spread between 3-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes inverted for the first time since 2007, which gave succor to the Fed's decision to begin cutting interest rates in July. It inverted briefly again on Tuesday for the first time since October as investors worried about the economic impact from a coronavirus outbreak in China. If it happens on a more prolonged basis, jitters could return.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graphic: Fed is watching the yield curve in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1568/1543/Pasted%20Image.jpg</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A SURPRISE?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As in real life, the Fed has to deal with unexpected events. And with the global economy so interconnected, what happens elsewhere is on the Fed's radar. From oil shocks in the 1970s and the Black Friday market collapse in the 1980s, to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, all have changed the course of interest rates. More recently, in 2015, the Fed raised rates less than it planned as financial markets dropped on concerns over slowing Chinese economic growth. So far this year, global financial markets have been temporarily rattled by the U.S. decision to kill a top Iranian military commander in a targeted air strike, which increased tensions between the two adversaries and sparked concerns of escalating unrest in the Middle East.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the biggest surprise so far has been China's coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, major stock indexes experienced their worst selloff in about four months on worries about the outbreak's impact on Chinese and global growth as the death toll rose. As a result, investors have brought forward estimates of a Fed rate move, with now roughly even odds the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates again by the end of July.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Paul Simao)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Powell, the Fed chair, walked a careful line in his post-meeting news conference, painting a picture of a solid economy that is fueled by strong job gains and a confident consumer willing to spend. But he noted that global risks remain, including the outbreak of a deadly new Coronavirus — and price gains remain surprisingly soft. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fed officials, whose job is to maintain both full employment and stable inflation, think the current economic situation merits a wait-and-see approach before they adjust rates again. The federal funds rate is currently set in a 1.5 to 1.75 percent range, and the decision to keep it steady was unanimous. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That patient approach contrasts sharply with the Fed’s experience in the second half of last year. The Fed cut borrowing costs three times from July to October as trade tensions and slowing global growth weighed on the economic outlook. That move itself marked a pivot from 2018, when the Fed was steadily raising rates to fend off higher inflation as unemployment sank steadily lower.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Powell has now signaled that the central bank does not plan move policy in either direction unless something fundamentally shifts. Central bankers do not expect to cut interest rates as long as the economy shapes up as expected, and do not intend to raise them unless inflation moves up and stays there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That is unlikely to sit well with President Trump, who has been pushing the central bank to slash rates further. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1222186473849544704" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">In a tweet on Tuesday</a>, Mr. Trump said “the Fed should get smart &amp; lower the Rate,” arguing that comparatively high rates in the United States are putting the country at a disadvantage.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The central bank does not answer to the White House, and officials regularly reiterate that they set a policy with an eye toward their twin goals, which are given to them by Congress.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But they are facing a complicated backdrop when it comes to achieving those targets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Expectations of a global growth turnaround have been climbing, helped along by an initial <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html" title="">trade deal between the United States and China</a> that brings some certainty and forestalls additional tariffs between the world’s largest economies. Mr. Trump also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/economy/usmca-deal.html" title="">signed a revised North American Free Trade Agreement</a> on Wednesday, bringing more than two years of fraught negotiations to a close.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But those positive signs could be dampened by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is forcing quarantines in China, shuttering multinational operations in the country and causing nervousness around the world. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Powell pointed to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html" title="">the new virus</a> as a potential economic threat at his news conference, though he said it was too early to know what its macroeconomic effect would be.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s a very serious issue,” Mr. Powell said. “There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and perhaps globally,” he said, adding that the Fed was “very carefully monitoring the situation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The chair also noted other persistent weak spots, including soft business investment and exports, which he attributed to “sluggish growth abroad and trade developments.” Manufacturing is also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/business/economy/manufacturing-economy-slowdown.html" title="">continuing to see a falloff</a>, though Mr. Powell suggested that weakness might be bottoming out. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It hasn’t gone away,” Mr. Powell said of trade uncertainty. “We need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Powell struck an optimistic tone about the United States economy overall, pointing out that employers are still hiring and unemployment continues to hover near a half-century low. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he sounded cautious about inflation, which continues to fall short of the Fed’s 2 percent target. It has not hit that rate of change sustainably since the central bank formally adopted the goal in 2012.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The annual price increase, as measured by the Fed’s favored index, came in at just 1.5 percent in November.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While sluggish price gains might sound positive, the Fed sees steady, gradual increases as better for the economy. Weak inflation leaves officials with less room to cut rates — which include price increases — in a downturn. And if consumers begin to expect slower increases, that outlook could become self-fulfilling, dragging inflation down further. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fed policymakers themselves do not expect it to eclipse 2 percent this year, based on their most recent set of economic projections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Powell said the Fed was “not comfortable with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In theory, inflation should be moving up,” he added, given that the United States economy is in its 11th year of an expansion and unemployment is very low, at 3.5 percent. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If inflation expectations slipped and dragged actual increases lower, “we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn, to the detriment of American families and businesses,” Mr. Powell said Wednesday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some analysts interpreted his wary tone as a sign that the Fed was still oriented more toward cutting rates than raising them. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a purely technical tweak, the central bank did nudge up the interest rates it pays on excess reserves — bank deposits stashed at the Fed. The move was meant to keep the Fed funds rate trading within its target range. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It also affirmed that it will continue purchasing Treasury bills “at least into” the second quarter of 2020. It <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/federal-reserve-meeting.html" title="">has been purchasing</a> short-term Treasury securities at a pace of $60 billion per month since October in a bid to keep the financial system flush with cash and to prevent money market ruptures, like one that reared its head in the repurchase market — or repo market — in September.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fed officials, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200129a1.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in a note released Wednesday</a>, said the ultimate goal was to “maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/business/economy/federal-reserve-treasury-bills.html" title="">prevailed in early September 2019</a>.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed said it would continue to conduct operations in the repo market “through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample” even in stressful periods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed has repeatedly said its ongoing interventions are not the type of mass bond-buying programs the central bank used to prop up the economy during and after the Great Recession. While those programs, known as quantitative easing, were meant to bolster the economy, the new interventions have been structured differently and are simply meant to fix a market-plumbing problem. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Investors have turned a skeptical eye on that claim, and equity analysts regularly argue that the purchases are pushing up stock prices, as markets take a cue from the Fed to buy. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Powell declined to speculate on whether that was the case in his comments, saying that “it’s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time.” </p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Here’s the latest.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">1. The impeachment trial of President Trump </strong>moved into cross-examination.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a week of silently hearing the case, senators <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html" title="">submitted written questions to the legal teams</a> representing the president and the House. Both sides used the opportunity to poke holes in their opponents’ case.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today’s session is expected to last into the night and resume again on Thursday. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-29?" title="">Follow along here</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, argued that any action taken by the president to help his own re-election would be, by definition, in the public interest. That’s an extraordinarily expansive view of executive power.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this could all be over in a matter of days. Senator Mitch McConnell, above, and other Republicans signaled that they were growing more confident they would be able to block new witnesses and documents — and that they could <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-29" title="">call a vote for acquittal as soon as Friday</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. A flight carrying 201 Americans</strong> <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">from Wuhan,</strong> the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, landed in Southern California this morning. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?" title="">Here’s the latest</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The passengers, being greeted above by health care workers, are to remain in place for three days of evaluations, then — if cleared — return home for two weeks of monitoring.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As anxiety grows, American <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/coronavirus-masks-hoarding.html" title="">stores are selling out of masks</a>. Health care workers risk infection if they cannot get the protective gear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. We’re still breaking down </strong>the<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>repercussions of President Trump’s Middle East peace plan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Palestinian leaders, completely left out of negotiations, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/middleeast/trump-peace-plan-explained.html" title="">flatly rejected the long-awaited plan</a>, which heavily favors Israel, a day after Mr. Trump presented it alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The deal has left Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, above center, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/middleeast/trump-peace-proposal-palestinians.html" title="">with few good options</a>, while his life’s work — a viable state side-by-side with Israel — slips away.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4. Stocks ended mixed on Wall Street </strong>after news of a signed trade deal and a Federal Reserve meeting. But concerns remain over the global impact of the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">President Trump signed a revised NAFTA into law, fulfilling a campaign promise to rewrite the North American trade rules. The deal, now called the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/economy/trump-signs-usmca-new-nafta-into-law.html?" title="">United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a>, includes stronger protections for workers and the digital economy, expanded markets for American farmers and new rules to encourage car making.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed, for its part, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/federal-reserve-meeting.html" title="">left rates unchanged</a> and offered few changes to its assessment of the economy’s health, suggesting it intends to remain patient.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. Elizabeth Warren</strong> is shifting her strategy and tackling the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa-caucus.html" title="">question of electability</a> head-on, days before the Iowa caucuses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her campaign has supplemented its policy-driven messaging with explicit talk about Ms. Warren’s identity as a female politician and her path to beating President Trump. Above, a stop in Davenport, Iowa, on Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And while other presidential candidates argue about one another’s health plans, Michael Bloomberg is mounting a more frontal attack on Mr. Trump’s record on health care. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/us/politics/bloomberg-trump-health-care.html?" title="">He has released a torrent of ads to do so</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6.

Together, the two bigger glaciers are holding back ice that, if melted, would raise the world’s oceans by more than a meter, or about four feet, over centuries, an amount that would put many coastal cities underwater.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7. Funeral plans for Kobe Bryant </strong>have not been publicly announced, but Los Angeles is preparing to accommodate thousands of mourners from across the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Staples Center, where Bryant played for most of his 20-year career with the Lakers, can hold about 20,000 people. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, among the largest venues in Southern California, can hold more than 77,000 people and has been floated as an alternative. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-death.html?" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Laying him to rest will be something which we are here, ready to help support the family however, wherever and whenever,” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles has said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Lakers will <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-athlete-deaths.html" title="">play on Friday for the first time</a> since Bryant’s death Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">8. A very different look at the sun.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is one of the most detailed images <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/science/daniel-inouye-solar-telescope-pictures.html" title="">of the sun’s surface</a> ever taken, by a new telescope in Hawaii.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It may look like popcorn from 93 million miles away, but each “kernel” is about the size of Texas. And each is the signature of almost incomprehensibly violent motion, in the form of thermonuclear reactions and boiling gas pocked with magnetic storms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The images came in an initial test of the National Science Foundation’s telescope, which is atop Haleakala, an ancient cratered volcano. It’s named for Daniel K. Inouye, the senator from Hawaii credited with helping build his state into an astronomical powerhouse.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">9. Jessica Simpson </strong>is ready to talk.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ahead of her new memoir, “Open Book,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/style/jessica-simpson-memoir-alcohol-addiction.html" title="">we sat down with the early-aughts pop star </a>to talk about addiction, sexual abuse as a child, dating John Mayer, divorce — and everything else.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Even though I have been so open about things that I’ve gone through in my life, I’ve never been open about them in an emotional way,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Our Styles writer says that Ms. Simpson delivers on the promise that stars are just like us, “only richer and prettier and with great, but maybe not greater, expectations.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">10. And finally, </strong>cracking a decades-old C.I.A. mystery.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Kryptos sculpture has been in a courtyard at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va., for almost 30 years. Three of its four passages have been decoded (the first was solved by a team from the National Security Agency). <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/29/climate/kryptos-sculpture-final-clue.html" title="">Now its creator is offering one final clue</a>: “NORTHEAST.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The puzzle, cut into a sheet of copper, has been a source of delight and consternation to thousands of people. Having a chance to solve a problem, one mathematician said, “gives people great pleasure.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Good luck, and hope you have a breakthrough tonight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/briefing/global-morning-briefing-newsletter-signup.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to get it by email in the Australian, Asian, European, African or American morning.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Want to catch up on past briefings? </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-evening-briefing" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">You can browse them here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">What did you like?

[<p>Advertisement</p>, <p>Supported by</p>, <p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70"></p>, <h1 class="css-1j5ig2m e1h9rw200" id="link-13078452" itemprop="headline"><span>Health Experts: Human-To-Human Spread of New Virus Worrying</span></h1>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">The Associated Press</span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BEIJING — World health officials expressed “great concern” Wednesday that a dangerous new virus is starting to spread between people outside of China, a troubling development as China and the world frantically work to contain the outbreak. For a second day, the number of infections grew dramatically.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. On Wednesday, the number of cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 people diagnosed with SARS. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The death toll, which rose to 170 on Wednesday, is still less than half the number who died in China from SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Scientists say there are many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how easily it spreads and how severe it is.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a report published Wednesday, Chinese researchers suggested that person-to-person spread among close contacts occurred as early as mid-December. Based on the first 425 confirmed cases, the researchers estimate that each infection led to 2.2 others on average. That’s a bit more than ordinary flu but far less than some other respiratory diseases such as whooping cough and tuberculosis. The rate for SARS, a cousin to this new virus, was estimated to be 3. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Considerable efforts” will be needed to control the spread if this ratio holds up elsewhere, researchers wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than half of the cases in which symptoms began before Jan. 1 were tied to a seafood market, but only 8% of cases after that have been, researchers found. They reported the average incubation period was five days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said the few cases of human-to-human spread of the virus outside China — in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam — were of “great concern” and were part of the reason the U.N. health agency’s director-general was reconvening a committee of experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Michael Ryan spoke at a news conference in Geneva after returning from a trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. He said China was taking “extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge" posed by the outbreak. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To date, about 99% of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ryan noted there were several aspects of the new virus outbreak that are extremely worrying, citing the recent rapid spike in cases in China. He said that while scientists believe the outbreak was sparked by an animal virus, it’s unclear if there are other factors driving the epidemic. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Without understanding that, it’s very hard to put into context the current transmission dynamics,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meanwhile, countries began evacuating their citizens from the Chinese city hardest-hit by the virus. Chartered planes carrying about 200 evacuees each arrived in Japan and the United States as other countries planned similar evacuations from the city of Wuhan, which authorities have shut down to try to contain the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. plane arrived in California after a refueling stop in Alaska. All 195 passengers, who included diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, passed health screenings in China and Anchorage, and were to undergo three days of monitoring at a Southern California military base to ensure they show no signs of the illness.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The whole plane erupted into cheers when the crew welcomed them back to the United States," Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska's chief medical officer, told reporters in Anchorage.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Four passengers on the evacuation flight to Japan had coughs and fevers, and two were diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn't clear whether they were infected with the new virus, which first appeared in Wuhan in December. Its symptoms, including cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, are similar to many other illnesses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.’s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to return home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,” Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first cases in the Middle East were confirmed Wednesday, a family of four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of cases in China rose to 1,459 from the previous day, a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported Tuesday. Australia, Finland and Singapore were among those reporting new cases, as the number outside China topped 70. The vast majority are people who came from Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Australia, New Zealand and Britain were among the latest countries to announce they are planning evacuations. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">British health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said the steps are justified to prevent the introduction of the virus and its spread. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There's always a balance between the draconian measures of public health and what people might want to do, and obviously it's regrettable if people who turn out not to have the virus are quarantined unnecessarily," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In China's Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, China was slammed for hiding that outbreak for months, allowing it to spread unchecked before reporting it to the WHO. Even after inviting international experts to investigate the epidemic, SARS patients were moved from hospitals and driven around in ambulances to conceal the true extent of the virus’ spread. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although the Chinese health minister and others have suggested that the virus is spreading before people get symptoms, data to confirm that has not yet been shared widely beyond China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s still unclear whether that takes place,” said Malik Peiris, chair in virology at the University of Hong Kong. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The fortunate thing about SARS, if there was anything fortunate, was that transmission did not take place before symptoms,” he said. If it turns out that the new coronavirus can indeed be spread by people who don’t show any symptoms, “a pandemic is a scenario that we have to consider.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Associated Press writers Maria Cheng and Jill Lawless in London; Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska; Amy Taxin in Riverside, California; and Christina Larson in Washington contributed to this report.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The number of confirmed cases jumped to 7,711, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China from SARS. The virus has killed 170 people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The British and U.S. carriers on Wednesday joined several Asian carriers that are either suspending or significantly cutting back service there as fears spread about the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air are also halting all flights to the country, and Indonesia’s Lion Air plans to do the same. Other carriers including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia are slashing service.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond disrupting travel, the move is heightening concerns about the broader economic impact of the virus outbreak. Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries suffering the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. The crisis has also begun to ripple through U.S. companies with operations in China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a conference call Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Isaac Larian, CEO of MGA Entertainment, the maker of the popular LOL dolls, said he's nervous that many workers won't come back to factories and they may close. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I'm very concerned about all consumer goods and retail business in 2020," Larian said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks’ shares tumbled 2.5% Wednesday after the company said it will take a financial hit from store closures in China. The Seattle-based coffee giant said more than half of its 4,292 stores in China are now closed. China represented 10% of Starbucks’ revenue during its most recent quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By contrast, McDonald’s shares were up 2% Wednesday after the company said the financial impact so far has been minimal. McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said the Chicago-based company has closed several hundred restaurants, including all of its properties in Hubei province. But 3,000 remain open elsewhere in the country. China accounts for 4-5% of McDonalds’ revenue, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">British Airways said it was immediately suspending all flights to and from mainland China after the U.K. government warned against unnecessary travel to the country amid a virus outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The airline operates daily flights from London's Heathrow Airport to Shanghai and Beijing. It took the measure a day after Britain's Foreign Office updated its travel advice on China, warning against “all but essential travel” to the mainland, not including Hong Kong and Macao.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. has not put into place travel restrictions, though Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said “it’s important to not take anything off the table,” when he was asked about that potential. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">American Airlines said Wednesday it will suspend flights between Los Angeles and both Shanghai and Beijing from Feb. 9 through Mar. 27. The airline cited “the significant decline in demand for travel to and from China.” Flights from Dallas-Fort Worth will continue, the airline said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China has cut off access to the central city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. That has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The outbreak has infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online flight notice boards for the Beijing and Shanghai airports showed numerous cancellations for both domestic and foreign airlines on Wednesday: </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Air Seoul, a budget airline, became the first South Korean airline to suspend its fights to mainland Chinese destinations apart from Wuhan, stopping its flights to the cities of Zhangjiajie and Linyi.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Indonesia's Lion Air said it has canceled more than 50 flights to China well into February. The flights are from five international airports in Manado, Surabaya, Jakarta, Batam and from Denpasar, in Bali, to 15 airports in China. The suspension will be phased in gradually and continue until further notice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March in response to government virus-control efforts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Cathay Pacific Group said flights to 24 mainland destinations would be reduced to 240 weekly. The company owns Cathay Pacific Airways, cargo carrier Air Hong Kong, Cathay Dragon and Hong Kong Express.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Air India is suspending Delhi-Shanghai flights, which operate six times a week, from Friday until Feb. 14.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Finland's Finnair, which has actively promoted its position linking Asian and Western destinations, said it was canceling three weekly flights to Beijing Daxing International Airport through late March, as well as its twice-weekly flights to Nanjing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Jetstar Asia will temporarily suspend flights to the Chinese cities of Hefei, Guiyang and Xuzhou starting Thursday through the end of March due to a drop in demand.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-South Korea's second-largest carrier, Asiana Airlines, will temporarily suspend flights to the Chinese cities of Guilin, Changsha and Haikou starting next month. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">-Korean Air, South Korea’s biggest airline, said it is also considering grounding some of its flights to mainland China as passenger demand drops.

If they've left, don't let them come back."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Red tape was tied across the road at the entrance to the small community Monday. Village committee members wearing face masks and high-visibility vests manned the blockade. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since last week, a public address system had been broadcasting messages, residents told Reuters, warning people against inviting guests and urging anyone who has been to Wuhan, the epicentre of a spreading coronavirus that has killed 106 people, to register with authorities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We grow our own leeks ... we have a lot of frozen pork, rice and oil. There's no need for us to go outside," villager Lu Weian, who lives in a traditional village house with high walls, told Reuters by phone. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Every house is its own quarantine zone," she said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The village, hundreds of miles from Wuhan, is one of many across China shunning outsiders amid rising panic over the virus that has infected thousands. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A decision by authorities to lock down travel in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, has spurred a counter-movement of communities closing their gates to outsiders.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Social media showed dozens of images and videos from across China of similar vigilante efforts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some showed villages blocking roads with vehicles, others constructing make-shift barriers out of tape and cinder-blocks. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Zhengding county in Hebei province, outside Beijing, on Monday began offering 1,000 yuan ($145) to tipsters for credible information about unregistered people who may have links to Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We've done our work very carefully and registered everyone coming from the epidemic regions," said a man surnamed Ye who was manning the tip line at the county's Communist Party office when Reuters called on Tuesday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We haven't got useful tips, though there are people calling offering clues. In most cases they spotted cars with Hubei plates," he said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">'LIVES COME FIRST'</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The efforts aren't limited to villages. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In central Beijing, some residents and authorities are tracking and registering people who have been to Wuhan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It's our responsibility to find everyone and enforce safety... No one should be afraid to be an informant," said Chen Gang, a retired resident in central Dongcheng district, who is a designated community leader in his neighbourhood.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Saturday, Chen went door-to-door helping officials check whether people had recently visited Wuhan or had guests from Hubei. He said several people with Wuhan links were told to stay at home for a quarantine period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For people from Wuhan, the stigma is causing emotional strain.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I think I'm the loneliest person in the world right now," said 23-year-old Peking University student Carmen Wang, a Wuhan native who cancelled plans to return home from Beijing when news of the virus broke. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wang said she has been shunned by classmates, who sent messages in a class group chat warning others not to visit her. She orders out for food and watches TV alone. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Even if they came and ate food with me or hung out, if I even sneezed, they would accuse me ... it's better this way," said Wang.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Villagers took pains to justify their exclusivity.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It's not that we are without human emotions, but lives come first," read a sign attached to an earth-moving machine parked across a road to block traffic in an image posted on social media.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A man who answered a call from Reuters to the phone number listed on the sign declined to give the location of the village. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I don't want to tell you because I don't want you coming here," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Cate Cadell and Sophie Yu; Editing by Tony Munroe and Nick Macfie)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5,974 Wednesday, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kempczinski said 3,000 restaurants remain open in China, including some that are feeding health care workers. He said the outbreak is worrisome, but China only accounts for 4-5% of the company's systemwide revenue. That's less exposure than Starbucks, which said Tuesday that 10% of its revenue comes from China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small assuming it stays contained to China," Kempczinski said during a conference call with analysts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That was a relief to investors, who pushed McDonald's stock up more than 2% to $216.25 in morning trading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kempczinski said his top priority is improving U.S. customer traffic, which has been falling for more than a year. U.S. same-store sales — or sales at restaurants open at least 13 months — rose 5% in the fourth quarter, but that was driven by higher prices and delivery. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McDonald's said Dynamic Yield, a system that recommends products on drive-thru menus based on weather and other factors, is also convincing customers to add items like donut sticks to their orders. McDonald's purchased Dynamic Yield last March and has added it to menu boards in the U.S. and Australia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kempczinski said it's critical for McDonald's to perform better at breakfast, since that's the only time of day U.S. restaurant traffic is growing. McDonald's is also facing increased competition as Wendy's reintroduces a breakfast menu.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McDonald's plans menu changes and competitive pricing at breakfast, Kempczinksi said. The company is also testing a new chicken sandwich to better compete with Chick-fil-A and Popeye's.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come from stealing share," Kempczinski said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McDonald's plans to open 1,400 new restaurants this year, including 450 in China. Almost all of those restaurants will be outside the U.S. McDonald's has 38,695 restaurants worldwide; 13,846 are in the U.S.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Delivery was a big driver of the gains this year. Delivery is now available at 25,000 restaurants worldwide and brought in $4 billion in sales. That's up from $1 billion in 2016. The company added DoorDash as a U.S. partner in July, ending its exclusive partnership with UberEats. It partnered with GrubHub in September.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McDonald's Corp. fourth-quarter net income rose 11% to $1.6 billion, or $2.08 per share. Excluding one-time items like tax benefits, the company earned $1.97 per share. That beat Wall Street's forecast of $1.96, according to FactSet. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fourth-quarter revenue was up 4% to $5.3 billion, which was in line with estimates.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Same-store sales jumped 5.9% worldwide in the October-December quarter, topping analysts expectations. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">France and the United Kingdom were among the top performers internationally, the company said. The UK saw its 55th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, driven by extended breakfast hours and delivery.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kempczinksi became president and CEO in November after former President and CEO Steve Easterbrook was ousted for violating company policy by having a consensual relationship with an employee. Kempczinski most recently led the company's U.S. operations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kempczinski said he has spent the past few months visiting restaurants, talking with franchisees and hosting town halls with employees.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry," he said.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Shares rose nearly 12% in after-hours trading Wednesday to $648.50 </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company said in its quarterly investor letter that it is starting to ramp up production of the Model Y small SUV in Fremont, California. The Model Y is a key product for Tesla's future because consumers are buying smaller utility vehicles. Deliveries are to start by the end of March.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Model Y will be able to go up to 315 miles (507 kilometers) per charge, an increase over Tesla's previous estimate of 280 miles (451 kilometers), according to the letter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla also expects to “comfortably” exceed production of 500,000 vehicles this year at its factories in Fremont and Shanghai. Model Y production in Shanghai will start in 2021. The company also said it plans to start producing limited numbers of its electric semi truck this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a conference call Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is making progress on a full self-driving feature that he has said will be deployed this year. But the company still has a long way to go before its vehicles can travel without humans taking the wheel. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, Musk said he expected to start converting Teslas to self-driving in 2020 as part of a plan to create a network of robotic taxis to compete against ride-hailing services. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Critics have said Tesla doesn't have the sensors or proper technology to offer fully self-driving vehicles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The coronavirus outbreak in China could temporarily delay production at the company's new Shanghai factory, Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said, and that may have a small impact on Tesla's first-quarter profitabilty. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company hasn't seen any parts-supply disruptions due to the outbreak but is monitoring the situation, he said. “This is an evolving story.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Musk said demand for the company's angular “Cybertruck” pickup has been high, but gave no numbers. “The demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of three or four years, something like that,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla also said in its investor letter that it's moving ahead with preparations for a factory near Berlin, and the first deliveries from the factory are expected next year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla expects net profits going forward, with some possible exceptions at times surrounding the launch of new products.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We continue to believe our business has grown to the point of being self-funding,” the letter said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla shares have more than tripled in value since May of last year, pushing the company’s market value above giant German automaker Volkswagen as well as the combined values of General Motors and Ford.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The electric vehicle and solar panel maker's fourth-quarter revenue grew 2% to $7.38 billion as Tesla delivered about 112,000 vehicles during the period and a record 367,500 for the full year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla continued to build its cash balance during the fourth quarter, reporting $6.27 billion available. That’s up from $5.34 billion at the end of the third quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives called Tesla's performance “potentially game changing,” and a sign of what could be a new era for CEO Elon Musk and the company. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We would characterize the fundamental performance as impressive with clear momentum looking ahead as a global inflection in EV (electric vehicle) demand appears on the horizon,” Ives wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This story has been updated to correct the per-share fourth-quarter net earnings number.

A day or two later, she broke out in a bright red rash that inflamed her cheeks. “Fifth disease,” her pediatrician said, milliseconds after she walked into the exam room. I had never heard of it, and at first I thought she said “fist disease,” and I pictured a giant fist kneading my baby’s face, leaving that mass of red.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it turns out fifth disease — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/parvovirusb19/fifth-disease.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">which is caused by parvovirus B19</a> — is just one of many weird rash-causing illnesses that are common in children under 6. The illness is named after a number because decades ago, doctors didn’t know what caused once-common childhood conditions like measles, mumps and rubella, so they referred to them sequentially, said Dr. Nanette Silverberg, M.D., chief of pediatric dermatology for the Mount Sinai Health System. Fifth disease retained the number.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“One of the really challenging things about raising children is they almost always have a virus, and most of the time you don’t even know,” said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. “You could be the most conscientious parent, but they’re going to get viruses, and they’re often shedding them without having any symptoms.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What a magical, germ-strewn adventure we are all on.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because rash-causing illnesses are omnipresent, we created an illustrated guide to five common ones that occur in young children: Scarlet fever, fifth disease, roseola, hand, foot and mouth disease and impetigo. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://parenting.nytimes.com/childrens-health/child-rash-roseola-fifth-disease" title="">Click here to read the whole thing</a>, and please don’t read it during breakfast because I use the word “crust” in a repeated and foul manner!</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If you’re concerned that your child has one of these maladies (or any unexplained rash), give your pediatrician a call.

It said on Wednesday that the process would remain suspended until the charges against the federation were determined. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This means that Russia's top track and field athletes are likely to miss the 2020 winter season, that will not include the world indoor championships. The event, which had been scheduled to take place in March in Nanjing, China, has been postponed to 2021 over fears related to the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if Russia's federation officials continue to deny involvement, World Athletics said it will "put all necessary resource into presenting the charges to the CAS".</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russia's athletics federation had no immediate comment. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a jab at the federation, world champion pole vaulter Anzhelika Sidorova tagged it in an Instagram story and wrote "good job", accompanied by three flexed biceps emojis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russia is also in the process of appealing a four-year ban from competing under its flag at major international sporting events, including this year's Tokyo Olympics, after WADA found Moscow had provided it with doctored laboratory data. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber in Moscow and Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Ed Osmond)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Thousands of cases have been reported in China, with a small number in countries including the United States, Thailand and Singapore.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The unprecedented move prompted people in the city of 11 million to rush to supermarkets to stock up on instant noodles, vegetables and whatever else they could put their hands on.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents say there has yet to be an acute shortage of food, although shelves are cleared quickly when goods arrive.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shouguang, the country's biggest vegetable production base, in the eastern Shandong province, has been asked to deliver 600 tons of fresh vegetables to Wuhan every day in the next 10 to 15 days, said an official in Sunjiaji, one of Shouguang's villages. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sunjiaji, whose main crop is cucumbers, was tasked with sending 60 tons in less than seven hours.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We got the order from our city government at 11 p.m. on Monday and we immediately contacted our farmers, asking them to pick cucumbers overnight and bring their harvest to us before 6 a.m.," the official, who only gave her surname, Li, told Reuters by phone. "We sent 70 tons in the end," she said. "We are waiting for the next order."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China's largest food and agricultural firm COFCO Group and China Grain Reserves Corporation (Sinograin) Group have stepped up supplies of rice, meat and cooking oil to Hubei province, state media reported on Wednesday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on Thursday, urging related departments to coordinate to maintain ample supplies of vegetables and stable prices. Other areas like Xinjiang are also sending supplies. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Delivery trucks carrying food are exempt from travel restrictions if they have government permits. Authorities have cracked down on cases of price hikes and publicized them to warn others.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, a supermarket in Zhengzhou in Henan Province was fined 500,000 yuan ($72,421) for selling Chinese cabbage at 63 yuan, instead of the usual 17 yuan, according to local media.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The green channel into Wuhan is smooth," said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during a visit to the city this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">STILL TOUGH</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Others in Wuhan said it was far from smooth. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Worries over how long the city's quarantine might last are spurring many to stockpile, a Wuhan resident said. People across China have been told to stay away from public areas to lower the risk of infection and many stay indoors. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"In the morning there are vegetables in supermarkets but the shelves are cleared quickly as a lot of people buy large amounts," she said, describing stores as "war zones". "You buy whatever's left on the shelf because that will be gone too."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wushang Group, the largest local supermarket in Wuhan with nearly 30 stores, said its biggest challenge was a lack of staff and almost all company employees had become delivery personnel, opting to use their private cars to transport goods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their cars are sometimes stopped by police due to the travel restrictions, but are usually let go if they explain that they are transporting supplies, said a company official who would only give her surname as Gan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"On the night of Jan. 25, 400 tons of vegetables arrived in Wuhan from Chongqing and we were given 120 tons," she said. About a hundred Wushang employees volunteered to unload and transport the goods, she said. "On average every person unloaded more than a ton of vegetables that night." </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lack of staff and delivery services is plaguing other parts of the food supply chain in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, others said. A number of smaller cities in Hubei have also been locked down due to the outbreak. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan's largest wholesale grocery outlet, the Baishazhou Agricultural Products Market, supplies supermarkets and big restaurants in neighbouring cities in Hubei province, such as Huangshi and Jiujiang, but is seeing fewer customers due to the restrictions. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We have plenty of vegetables," said Yuan, an employee in the market's vegetable department.

All the deaths so far have been in China, where the National Health Commission said there had been 132 fatalities as of end-Tuesday. Another death was reported in Sichuan province on Wednesday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The situation remained "grim and complex", said Chinese President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday had vowed to defeat the "devil" virus. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Xi and his administration was working closely with China on containing the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some major airlines suspended flights to China, and a senior economist predicted a major impact on growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The WHO's panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency, but will re-evaluate the situation on Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted," said Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ryan also praised China's response, saying: "They are taking extraordinary measures in the face of what is an extraordinary challenge."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">STREETS DESERTED</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In many Chinese cities, streets were largely deserted. Tourist attractions were closed, while Starbucks coffee shops required people to have their temperatures taken and to wear masks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It's my first time here in Asia, I feel very unlucky," said Brazilian tourist Amanda Lee, 23, cutting short a trip. "I couldn't even see the places I wanted, like the Great Wall."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Almost all the deaths so far have been in the central province of Hubei, home to about 60 million people and now under virtual lockdown. The virus emerged last month in a live wild animal market in the provincial capital Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I was extremely worried that I was stuck there," said Takeo Aoyama, who arrived in Tokyo on a chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese out of Wuhan as some governments began evacuating their citizens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States flew about 210 Americans out of Wuhan, to be screened several times on arrival in California. France said a first flight of French nationals would leave on Wednesday night and Britain said it would put 200 citizens on a charter plane on Thursday. Canada was also organising evacuations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus is weighing heavily on the world's second-biggest economy, with companies cutting corporate travel to China and tourists cancelling trips. Various airlines are cutting flights, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Tanzania's national carrier that postponed maiden flights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A government economist said the crisis could cut China's first quarter growth by one point to 5% or lower as the crisis hits sectors from mining to luxury goods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hong Kong stocks took a beating on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break. Casino and financial stocks led the Hang Seng index 2.5% lower to a seven-month trough.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"In our view, the worst is yet to come," securities firm Nomura said, warning of a severe, near-term blow to China's economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">'LESS DEADLY THAN SARS'</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in a potentially major step towards finding a vaccine, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the virus, the first recreated outside China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the WHO and global laboratories in the hope of hastening immunisation and detection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of cases of the new virus in China now exceeds the 5,327 that were infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China and killed about 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While some experts believe the new strain, known as "2019-nCoV", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its rapid spread and many unknown attributes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"There have been more cases in China, but so far with a lower death rate than the SARS outbreak," said Michael Head, a health researcher at Britain's University of Southampton.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like other respiratory infections, the new virus is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes, with an incubation time between one and 14 days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Cheng Leng in Shanghai, Se Young Lee, Lusha Zhang, Gabriel Crossley, Tony Munroe, Huizhong W, Judy Hua, Nanlin Fang and Joyce Zhou in Beijing and Stephanie Nebehay and Emma Farge in Geneva; Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Matthias Blamont in Paris, Akira Tomoshige in Tokyo, Kate Kelland in London, Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Writing by Robert Birsel, Andrew Cawthorne and Alex Richardson; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Nick Macfie and Hugh Lawson)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

It's a lot of mileage to patrol, but officials say they are well prepared. They had been planning for months and running drills.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maj. Ed Caneva, the Miami-Dade Police Department operations commander for the NFL title game, said they identify a raft of different scenarios. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We have been training and addressing anything,” Caneva said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Super Bowl has long been considered a potential target for terrorists or other violent extremists, and this year the game will be played amid rising tensions with Iran. But none of the games has ever been attacked. Anthony Salisbury, chief of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami, said law enforcement agencies nonetheless must be prepared.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s all hands on deck,” Salisbury said. “This is a high-profile event. It’s the same with every Super Bowl. Nothing is being taken for granted.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several thousand federal, state and local law enforcement officials are involved in the game and the events leading up to it. Brian Swain, chief of the Miami Secret Service office and lead federal coordinator for the event, said there’s no intelligence thus far indicating any kind of threat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is no specific credible threat right now,” Swain said. “I’m confident in our security plan.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Streets will be blocked off. There will be scores of uniformed police officers and others in plainclothes roaming the stadium to ensure safety. Bomb-sniffing dogs will patrol, and fans must go through metal detectors. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed flight restrictions over Hard Rock Stadium and around some of the other events. The FAA has even produced a video called “No Drone Zone,” intended to curb the devices around game activities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Enjoy the Super Bowl. Leave your drone at home,” the video says.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Commercial flights at Miami International Airport are unaffected. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And while officials haven't expressed concerns for the game due to travelers arriving infected with a new coronavirus from China, Miami's airport is on the list of 20 nationally where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have expanded screening. CDC officials are taking temperatures of travelers from China and asking them to fill out a questionnaire.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than 10,000 staff members and volunteers will also use a phone app called SaferWatch to report crimes and suspicious activity during the Super Bowl and the events leading up to the game. Threats and crimes reported on the app — which is free and available to the public — will be fed directly to onsite police command centers, letting law enforcement officials manage up-to-the-minute intelligence. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company’s CEO, Geno Roefaro, said being able to bring together police, fans, staff members and volunteers to share potential threats in real time is “what our technology is all about and what makes our work across industry so rewarding.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There has been one potential close call in a past Super Bowl: Five years ago, federal authorities said they encountered a plot in Phoenix by a man who wanted to attack the Super Bowl and an adjacent mall and entertainment district in Glendale, Arizona, with pipe bombs. They said the man, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, was unable to obtain the explosives, and the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks was not hit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kareem later was convicted of conspiring to provide the guns used in an attack on a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas in which two heavily armed associates were killed by local police officers. He also was convicted of providing support to the Islamic State group. His lawyers asked a judge to grant him a new trial or throw out his convictions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year’s Super Bowl will be the Miami area’s 11th, the most ever. Hard Rock Stadium is home to the Miami Dolphins and the University of Miami Hurricanes and hosts concerts for major acts including The Rolling Stones.

The CBO projects that deficits will average $1.3 trillion a year over the coming decade, with the economy settling into steady but sluggish growth. That’s the most disturbing thing about the report: the expectation that giant deficits will be allowed to continue even when there’s no recession driving up spending on federal safety net programs and causing tax revenue to plummet.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s not inherently bad for the federal government to borrow money; extra spending by the government can help stimulate the economy during a downturn. But sustained and heavy deficit spending can have the opposite effect, raising borrowing costs and slowing GDP growth. The CBO projects that the fastest growing part of the federal budget will be interest payments on the rising debt — spending that delivers no tangible benefit for taxpayers while leaving less money for programs that do.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rising healthcare costs and an aging population are contributing to the federal budget mess. But the problem has been exacerbated by the large and irresponsible tax cuts Republicans pushed through in 2017. The cuts were sold as a way to trigger a sustained surge in economic growth; instead, GDP bumped up only briefly, held back in part by the tariffs President Trump slapped on a broad array of imports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We’ve seen this movie before. Some supposed fiscal conservatives will demand more tax cuts to try to jump-start faster growth (in fact, Trump and House Republicans floated just such an idea before the 2018 election and again last year). Others will blame the problem on federal spending and demand cuts — not to the military and security programs that Trump has vastly expanded, not to the vast tax giveaways and subsidies, but to the safety net programs the administration is already trying to restrain.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Slashing programs such as Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for the GOP tax cuts would be redistributing wealth in the worst way — from the impoverished to the well-to-do. The right answer starts with lawmakers rolling back the tax-cut and spending excesses of the Trump administration. They can then work on a longer-term plan to bring spending and revenue back into line.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">https://www.latimes.com/</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jan. 29</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier of Iowa on the death of basketball superstar Kobe Bryant:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kobe Bryant was a unicorn — one of those people recognized worldwide by a first name — driven to succeed in sports, business and the arts — until his life shockingly ended Sunday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bryant, 41, and his daughter, Gianna (“Gigi”), 13, a budding basketball star, were among nine victims as his leased helicopter crashed in dense fog west of Los Angeles en route from Orange County to a game at his Mamba Academy, 80 miles away.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was named after a steak served at a Japanese restaurant. His father, Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, was a National Basketball Association journeyman. His mother’s brother, Chubby Cox, played briefly in the NBA.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From age 6, he grew up in Italy while his father played in Europe. He learned Italian. He did a grade-school book report in Latin.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He returned home as a basketball prodigy at Lower Merion High near Philadelphia, escorting pop star Brandy to his prom. He was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in the 13th round and traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He then became the youngest ever to play in the NBA.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 20 years with the Lakers, Bryant scored 33,643 points — fourth all-time after being passed by LeBron James Saturday night. He won five titles, made 18 All-Star teams, won a regular-season MVP award and two in the NBA Finals. He scored 81 points in a game, 40 points or more in nine straight, and 50 or more in four straight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was brilliant and divisive. Coach Phil Jackson called him “uncoachable.” He feuded with co-star Shaquille O’Neal. After winning three titles together (2001-03), O’Neal was sent packing to Miami, winning a ring in 2006. Bryant teamed with Pau Gasol to win two titles in 2008-09.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After bowing out with a record 60 points in his final game, Bryant embellished his resume in business and the arts. He called on billionaires to improve his financial acumen and the likes of author J.K. Rowling to hone his storytelling.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bryant Stibel &amp; Co., a venture capital firm, had assets exceeding $2 billion with stakes in sports drink maker BodyArmor; Epic Games, which produces “Fortnite”; Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Dell. Forbes put his net worth at $680 million in 2016.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Mamba Mentality: How I Play,” was a best-selling book. His children’s series featured Legacy, a tenacious 12-year-old female tennis player in the magical kingdom of Nova: “For Legacy, it’s the only thing getting her through the long days taking care of the other kids at the orphanage.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2018, he was the first pro athlete to win an Oscar, turning his poem, “Dear Basketball,” into an animated short film, which he wrote and narrated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences denied him membership because of a 2003 incident at a Colorado resort when he was accused of raping a 19-year-old employee. His legal team and social media vilified her as a gold digger, although her family was wealthy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bryant eventually apologized, claiming he thought it was a consensual act. She dropped criminal charges. A civil suit was settled for a rumored $2.5 million.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jackson wrote the allegations didn’t surprise him: “Kobe can be consumed with surprising anger, which he’s displayed toward me and his teammates.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then Bryant transformed himself.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the court, he adopted the Black Mamba persona, after an assassin in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” movies. “I read up on the animal and said, ‘Wow, this is pretty awesome,’” Bryant said. “This is a perfect description of how I would want my game to be.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Off the court, he saw himself as the angry Hulk changing into mild-mannered David Banner, devoted to his wife, Vanessa, and daughters, Natalia, 16, Gianna, 13, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In retirement, he didn’t attend many Lakers games, saying, “I have a life and I have my routine at home. It’s not that I don’t want to go, but I’d rather be giving B.B. a shower and sing Barney songs to her. I played 20 years and I missed those moments before.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As YouTube videos attest, Gigi (aka “Mambacita”), a prodigy with UConn aspirations, emulated dad on the court. “It’s a trip to see her move and some of the expressions she makes,” Bryant said. “It’s a trip how genetics work.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other lives lost Sunday also were filled with promise or achievement: Gigi’s teammate Alyssa Altobelli and parents, Keri and John, a legendary junior college baseball coach with five state titles and more than 700 wins; teammate Payton Chester and her mother, Sarah; Christina Mauser, an assistant coach and mother of three. Pilot Ara Zobayan had ferried Bryant constantly above the traffic-congested L.A. area.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So many people tragically taken before their time, including one constantly evolving unicorn destined for the basketball Hall of Fame this year with so many other gifts waiting to be unwrapped.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online: https://wcfcourier.com/</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jan. 28</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Japan News on actions taken by Japan to the stop the spread of the coronavirus:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Infections with a new type of pneumonia have been spreading from China to the world. Chinese authorities have said that the new coronavirus’ ability to spread is getting stronger. In Japan, too, it is necessary to strengthen relevant measures, on the assumption that the number of infected patients will increase.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear a policy of naming the pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus as a “designated infectious disease” under the Infectious Diseases Law. This designation under the law will allow authorities to take such measures as the compulsory hospitalization of infected patients. The move is being taken in anticipation of the spread of infected patients, without waiting for a declaration by the World Health Organization that the spread of the new virus is a public health emergency of international interest.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of patients infected with the new type of coronavirus has topped 2,800 in mainland China alone, with the death toll rising to more than 80. Cases of infection have spread to more than 10 countries and regions in addition to mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In terms of the number of infected patients, the latest infections have been spreading on a larger scale than when Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) broke out in 2012. The situation is getting more serious.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Wuhan in China’s Hubei Province — a city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak — outbound transport services have been shut down, virtually sealing off the city. The daily life of Japanese people living there has been hindered, and there is growing unease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Japanese government is working to send privately chartered flights to bring back the Japanese still in Wuhan who want to return to Japan. Other countries, including the United States and South Korea, are also considering sending chartered flights there, so these measures are deemed appropriate from the viewpoint of protecting citizens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has started banning group tours with overseas destinations. This is aimed at preventing a large number of Chinese people from going abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period, thus stemming the infection from spreading further.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This move taken by China can be considered to indicate a sense of alarm over the spread of infections, which is faster than it initially expected. The Chinese government should take such positions as quickly disclosing information about infected patients and the virus to other countries and seeking cooperation from them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Japan, infected patients, including a Chinese tourist, have been discovered almost on a daily basis. The number of Chinese holidaymakers who visited Japan totaled about 9.6 million last year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hotels and other accommodations should vigorously provide guests who are in poor physical condition with health care information. Hospitals, for their part, should make arrangements to be ready to accept foreign patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whether infections may spread from human-to-human contact within Japan will be watched carefully in the days ahead. The possibility also remains that the virus may mutate and become stronger, or the fatality rate may rise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early symptoms of the new type of pneumonia may include those similar to a common cold, such as fever and diarrhea. There have also been cases in which elderly people and people with chronic illnesses have become seriously ill, so attentive care is vital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At present, the percentage of those who die from the new type of pneumonia is not as high as those recorded in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or MERS. A level-headed response should be made, based on accurate information.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online: https://the-japan-news.com/</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jan. 28</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wall Street Journal on Virginia and labor laws:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Democrats in Virginia aren’t wasting time with their first statehouse majority in 26 years — by repealing the state’s 70-year-old right-to-work law that has helped the commonwealth thrive.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twenty-seven states including Virginia have right-to-work laws that give workers a choice of whether to belong to a union. According to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, the rate of job growth was two times higher in right-to-work states between 2008 and 2018 than in states where workers can be compelled to join unions or pay dues as a condition of employment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This disparity is the result of a confluence of pro-growth policies including low taxes, but employers often cite right-to-work laws when deciding where to locate a new plant. Foreign automakers built factories in southern states largely because their right-to-work laws make it more difficult to conscript workers into unions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Right to work has also made Northern Virginia more attractive to businesses compared to Maryland’s Washington, D.C., suburbs. Northern Virginia last year accounted for 70% of new jobs in the D.C. metro area. Only 4% of Virginia workers belong to unions compared to 11.3% in Maryland. The share of construction workers who are unionized is five times higher in Maryland than Virginia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Progressives elected in last year’s statehouse sweep now hope to reward their labor supporters. Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw is driving legislation that would allow unions to require non-members to pay “fair share fees” to defray their costs for collective bargaining, organization and other “representation” activities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Supreme Court’s Janus decision (2018) forbids governments from requiring public workers to pay such union fees but said nothing about private workers. Under the Virginia bill, workers could be required to subsidize unions regardless of whether they join. This would repeal right-to-work in all but name.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Playing coy, Gov. Ralph Northam recently told a group of businesses that “I don’t want to do anything that would threaten our AAA bond rating or our status as the number one state for businesses ... such as repealing (Virginia’s) right-to-work law.” Don’t expect a veto.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meantime, Democrats in the U.S. House are moving legislation to prohibit right-to-work laws nationwide. Liberals can’t abide laws in prosperous and growing states that make Illinois and New York look bad.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online: https://www.wsj.com/</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jan. 27</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The New York Times on John Bolton being a witness at impeachment trial of President Donald Trump:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s just possible that common sense and reality have a shot at prying open the doors to the Senate chamber after all. After Republican senators claimed that it was perfectly reasonable to put a United States president on trial without hearing from any witnesses, a few of them are showing signs of recognizing that the truth matters. Or, at least, that the American people believe it does.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What’s changed? Shocking but not surprising revelations from John Bolton’s book manuscript, which The New York Times reported over the weekend, have made impossible to ignore what everyone has known for months: President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine to benefit himself politically, and against the strenuous objections of his top aides and both parties in Congress.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday morning, Mitt Romney, of Utah, said, “I think it’s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s refreshing to hear those words. And yet the fact that such a statement is noteworthy at all tells you how far from responsible governance Republicans have strayed. They hold 53 seats in the Senate, and yet the nation is waiting on just four — four! — to do the right thing and agree to call Mr. Bolton, the former national security adviser, and other key witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A far more representative attitude in the Republican caucus was expressed by Roy Blunt, of Missouri, who said on Monday, “Unless there’s a witness that’s going to change the outcome, I can’t imagine why we’d want to stretch this out for weeks and months.” With this tautology Senator Blunt gives away the game: All witness testimony to date — all presented as part of the House impeachment proceedings — has only strengthened the case against Mr. Trump, but Republicans will not vote to convict him under any circumstances. By definition, then, no witness in the Senate could possibly change the outcome.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reporting on Mr. Bolton’s manuscript, which is scheduled for publication in March, has scrambled that strategy. Mr. Bolton’s foreign-policy disagreements with Mr. Trump have been public knowledge for months. Last fall, Fiona Hill, a Russia expert and former Bolton aide, testified in the House that Mr. Bolton was alarmed by Mr. Trump’s aid-for-investigations scheme, which Mr. Bolton characterized as a “drug deal.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the manuscript, detailed descriptions of which were leaked to The Times, he recounts nearly a dozen instances in which he and other top administration officials pleaded with Mr. Trump to release the aid, to no avail. He describes Mr. Trump’s fixation on conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, and about the supposed corruption of Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador to Ukraine. He says that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted privately to him that he knew there was nothing to the theories regarding Ms. Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump fired last spring.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Bolton, a hard-line conservative with decades of service in Republican administrations, is no anti-Trump zealot, which makes his allegations against the president that much more devastating. And his decision to tell these stories publicly nearly certainly waives any claims of executive privilege Mr. Trump might try to assert over their communications.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Let’s not forget the newly revealed evidence that came to light on Saturday, in the form of a tape recording released by the lawyer for Lev Parnas, who had worked for Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, in the Ukraine scheme. Mr. Trump has denied even knowing Mr. Parnas, but on the tape the two men can be heard in conversation at a dinner in April 2018. “Get rid of her,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Yovanovitch. “Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. O.K.? Do it.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a late-night tweet, Mr. Trump angrily denied Mr. Bolton’s allegations. “I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,” Mr. Trump wrote.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You know what would be a good way to figure out who’s telling the truth? Subpoena Mr. Bolton to testify under oath.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This isn’t a close call. A majority of Americans of all political stripes want to hear from Mr. Bolton, at the least. They believe, as do congressional Democrats, that you can’t vote on whether to remove a president from office without getting the fullest possible account of his alleged offenses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Senate Republicans have so far refused to hear from any witnesses or to demand any documents, following the lead of Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has never hesitated to undermine the country’s institutions if he thinks doing so will help his party. Mr. McConnell and nearly all in his caucus seem to imagine that if they block their eyes and ears and let their mouths run, the turbulence of impeachment will eventually pass.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a risky strategy. One reason good lawyers insist on deposing witnesses and subpoenaing documentary evidence is to avoid any unwelcome surprises at trial. Mr. Bolton has now provided the latest of those surprises. It is surely not the last.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The most galling part is that Republicans have already admitted how bad the president’s behavior was. Back in September, Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders, said: “What would’ve been wrong is if the president had suggested to the Ukrainian government that if you don’t do what I want you to do regarding the Bidens, we’re not going to give you the aid. That was the accusation; that did not remotely happen.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Except that it did, as Mr. Bolton is apparently willing to say under oath. Republicans don’t want him to do that because they don’t want Americans to exercise the simple good judgment that Mr. Graham once did.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online: https://www.nytimes.com/</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jan. 27</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Washington Times on the suspension of Felicia Sonmez, a journalist from the Washington Post:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Felicia Sonmez, a journalist at Washington’s other newspaper, was one of the few who weighed in after Bryant’s death with a discordant note. As news of the helicopter crash broke, she tweeted a link to a Daily Beast article recounting the details of a 2003 sex assault charge that was brought against the then-Laker. (The case was eventually dropped and Bryant paid an undisclosed settlement.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Was Ms. Sonmez’s tweet in bad taste? Perhaps. The basketball star’s body had probably not even been removed from the hillside where the helicopter crashed when she issued it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What it was not, it would seem, was cause for professional punishment. Yet that’s exactly what Ms. Sonmez’s employer, The Washington Post, subjected her to. Tracy Grant, the newspaper’s managing editor, told the Daily Mail on Sunday that “National political reporter Felicia Sonmez was placed on administrative leave while The Post reviews whether tweets about the death of Kobe Bryant violated The Post newsroom’s social media policy.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So, to recap: A Washington Post journalist was suspended for the “crime” of tweeting a link to a factual article about a famous celebrity who had died recently. Since when has sharing credible news stories about important subjects been something that journalists aren’t supposed to do?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online: https://www.washingtontimes.com/</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jan. 24</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chicago Tribune on remembering Auschwitz:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Why did Auschwitz happen? Why? I don’t have an answer to that. How, I know.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">— Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivor</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fay Waldman survived Auschwitz. She survived because Josef Mengele, the depraved Nazi doctor, decided on her arrival at the concentration camp that she shouldn’t die. “I will never forget his lifting his black-leather gloved hand and pointing which way we should go, to the labor camp or to the death camp,” Waldman said at a Chicago-area Holocaust remembrance in 1985. “I was healthy and went to the labor camp while the rest of my family went the other way.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">THE VICTIMS OF NAZI HATE</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The terror at Auschwitz was both systematic and indiscriminate. The Germans murdered 1.1 million people at the extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Most of the victims were Jewish. They were gassed, shot or beaten to death. Thousands of inmates survived, though barely, as slave laborers. Some worked in mines or rock quarries. Some sorted the confiscated possessions of others prisoners to be shipped back to Germany. One small group, surely the unluckiest of survivors, was assigned to the Sonderkommando, the unit ordered to move corpses from the gas chambers to the ovens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There were children at Auschwitz too. Among the murdered and brutalized were sets of twins who became the subject of Mengele’s sadistic medical experiments. Most were killed afterward so their bodies could be dissected. One pair was sewn together as if to create a conjoined set. They died of gangrene. Eva Kor remembered being tied down and stuck with a needle. “They wanted to know how much blood a person can lose and still live,” she said years later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Jan. 27, 1945, the madness ended. With Germany in retreat, Soviet soldiers liberated the Auschwitz complex. “We saw emaciated, tortured, impoverished people,” Ivan Martynushkin, then a 21-year-old lieutenant, told CNN in 2010. “We could tell from their eyes that they were happy to be saved from this hell.” The Soviet troops found approximately 7,000 inmates. The Nazis had fled, taking 60,000 prisoners with them. Those who could not keep up were shot.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">DECADES LATER, WE REMEMBER</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fay Waldman of Lincolnwood died in 2015. Eva Kor of Terre Haute, Indiana, died last summer. Soon all the survivors of the German extermination camps will be gone, no longer bearing witness. Their testimonies will live on, though, via museums like the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie, documentaries like “Shoah,” books and archives. As long as those stories are shared, the lessons of the Holocaust won’t be forgotten. This is what makes anniversaries crucial to commemorate: They’re opportunities — excuses, if you will — to remember. The year 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the largest Nazi death complex, and the end to World War II. It’s a year filled with reflections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the 40th anniversary in 1985, ABC News anchor Peter Jennings visited Auschwitz with Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and Auschwitz survivor, to consider the horror of Nazi genocide. Jennings asked a logical question: How could the Jews of Europe have become victims in their own countries? How did they not recognize the German intention to exterminate the Jews? Why did they seemingly submit so easily? Wiesel had taken up this same question in his acclaimed memoir “Night,” in which Moishe the Beadle returned home to warn villagers after he survived a far-off Nazi massacre. No one believed him. His tale was too fantastical. The Jews put trust in a society that reviled them. Many Jews did flee before the war, but many did not.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Weisel told Jennings that the Nazi’s Final Solution was too well-conceived to fail:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We came from one world into another,” Wiesel said. “The killers killed and the victims died and the sky was blue and bread was bread. It worked. The Germans managed to create, beside creation, another creation. Beside human society another society, a parallel society, and that society was efficient. There were those who lit the fire, those who threw the children in the fire and it worked day after day and we had the feeling that it would never end.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">THE ACHING QUESTION: ‘WHY?’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Toward the end of his life, Wiesel spent hours in conversation with the Tribune’s Howard Reich for Reich’s book, “The Art of Inventing Hope: Intimate Conversations with Elie Wiesel.” Wiesel suggested that the Holocaust existed as a paradox: something too terrible to happen that also happened. An inconceivable reality. “Wiesel himself had said many times to me that the scale of this genocide could not be absorbed by the human psyche,” Reich wrote. To put it another way, citing Wiesel: The “How” of the Holocaust is far easier to grasp than the “Why.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor emeritus, in his book “Why? Explaining the Holocaust,” wrote that Nazi Germany existed in a feedback loop of hate. The regime of Adolf Hitler created “an ideological echo chamber in which leaders constantly harped on the threat the Jews supposedly constituted and the need for Germans to defend themselves against it.” Again, that better explains how the Holocaust happened than why.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Why Auschwitz? Because the Nazis decided. They identified a religious minority group who were contributors to European society yet outsiders, and declared them to be enemies — vermin to be eradicated because decimating a scapegoat can be advantageous. Six million European Jews died.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Why Auschwitz? There is no logical explanation, so there cannot be a satisfying answer. But the more we reflect on the Holocaust — the more we ask “Why?” — the closer we may come to understanding hate and recognizing inhumanity. Then maybe one day we can eradicate it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Online: https://www.chicagotribune.com/</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Although that figure was down from the $143 million it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/business/tesla-earnings.html" title="">reported for the previous quarter</a>, investors were far from daunted. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/tesla-stock-price.html" title="">Tesla’s shares</a> rose 12 percent in after-hours trading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The numbers suggest that Tesla has overcome the problems that plagued it in the first half of last year, when it lost more than $1 billion and scrambled to raise capital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla, which has never had a profitable year, ended 2019 with a loss of $862 million, less than its two previous annual losses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Revenue was $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter, the company said, up from $6.3 billion in the third quarter. It said it expected to “comfortably exceed” 500,000 vehicle deliveries this year, about a third more than in 2019.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla also said it had begun ramping up production of the Model Y at its factory in Fremont, Calif., with deliveries expected by the end of March, well ahead of a previous estimate for the fall. In a call with analysts after the results were released, Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said that he was confident the vehicle would find buyers and that the company was focused on building out supply.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re not too worried about demand,” he said. “We’re worried about production.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla’s shares ended regular trading on Wednesday at $580.99, a record closing price. Still, investors <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/tesla-stock-elon-musk.html" title="">remain deeply divided over</a> the company’s value, which has more than doubled in recent months to eclipse the market capitalizations of Volkswagen, Ford, General Motors and other established automakers. Some predict that Tesla will dominate the growing market for electric vehicles while others question both the size of that market and Tesla’s ability to ward off competition.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla’s pursuit of a global expansion rests largely on the success of a new factory in Shanghai, which this month began regular delivery of vehicles built there. The company is also building a factory <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/business/tesla-elon-musk-berlin.html" title="">outside Berlin</a>, bringing the fight for the electric vehicle market to the backyard of some of the world’s largest automakers. Deliveries from that factory are expected to begin next year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla’s global push isn’t without its risks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Production at the Shanghai factory is expected to be delayed by as much as a week and a half because of an official shutdown that has affected many businesses in response to the spread of the coronavirus, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, told the analysts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the electric-vehicle market grows, legacy carmakers and start-ups are also shoveling cash into making and marketing their own models. Fading tax credits in multiple countries may also depress Tesla’s sales. And the company could even become a victim of its own success.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla has become a major target of short-sellers, who hope to profit off what they see as an inevitable decline in the stock price. On social media, those short-sellers and other critics amplify reports of accidents involving unintended acceleration or the Autopilot driver-assistance system, along with other negative Tesla news.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of those issues have also caught the eye of federal investigators, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration looking into at least 14 crashes in which it believes Autopilot was engaged. The National Transportation Safety Board is meeting next month to look into one such accident in Mountain View, Calif., in 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the company has so far been successful at defying its critics, overcoming the struggles of early 2019 to finish construction on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/elon-musk-opened-tesla-s-shanghai-gigafactory-in-just-168-days" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Shanghai factory</a> on the company’s own aggressive timeline and deliver 367,500 vehicles for the year, on the low end of a promised range of 360,000 to 400,000. That progress elicited something of a mea culpa in a note on Wednesday from analysts at Bank of America, who acknowledged a “rude awakening.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite calling Tesla a “trailblazer,” the Bank of America analysts still count themselves among the pessimists and argue that the stock, which trades under the ticker symbol TSLA, is overvalued by at least $200.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We believe investor optimism about TSLA’s addressable market for electric vehicles, volume growth trajectory and, most importantly, sustainable profits/cash flow inflection is overblown,” they wrote before the quarterly results were released.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tesla said it expected to remain profitable going forward, “with possible temporary exceptions.” It ended 2019 with $6.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a 70 percent increase from the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to overseas growth, Tesla’s success this year is likely to be defined by the rollout of the Model Y, which will have an estimated range of 315 miles per charge, up from a previous estimate of 280 miles, the company said on Wednesday. The introduction of the relatively affordable Model 3 last year led Tesla to a record number of deliveries in the fourth quarter, accounting for about 80 percent of vehicles sold in that period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company said it expected the Fremont factory to be able to produce the Model Y and the Model 3 at a rate of 500,000 vehicles a year by mid-2020.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

An inversion, when 10-year yields fall below those on three-month bills, has in the past been a reliable indicator that a recession will follow in one to two years.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This part of the yield curve inverted last March for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The very front of the curve remained kinked, with bills yielding more than shorter-dated notes like 2-year, 3-year and 5-year maturities. However, those relationships are not as closely monitored as economic bellwethers. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, while a recession may be likely to follow an inversion, the timing is uncertain, and loose monetary policy globally could result in any downturn taking longer to materialise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some analysts also think that the relative attractiveness of U.S. bonds to those in Europe and Japan, many of which have negative yields, is keeping longer-dated yields below where they would otherwise be, reducing the accuracy of the yield curve inversion as a recession signal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHAT IS THE TREASURY YIELD CURVE?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The yield curve is a plot of the yields on all Treasury maturities - debt sold by the federal government - ranging from 1-month bills to 30-year bonds. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In normal circumstances, it has an arcing, upward slope because bond investors expect to be compensated more for taking on the added risk of owning bonds with longer maturities. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When yields further out on the curve are substantially higher than those near the front, the curve is referred to as steep. So a 30-year bond will deliver a much higher yield than a 2-year note.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the gap, or "spread", is narrow, it is referred to as a flat curve. In that situation, a 10-year note, for instance, may offer only a modestly higher yield than a 3-year note.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHAT IS A CURVE INVERSION?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On rare occasions, some or all of the yield curve ceases to be upward sloping. This occurs when shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones and is called an inversion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While various economic or market commentators may focus on different parts of the yield curve, any inversion of the yield curve tells the same story: An expectation of weaker growth in the future.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March, inversion of the yield curve hit 3-month T-bills for the first time in about 12 years when the yield on 10-year notes &lt;US10YT=RR&gt; dropped below those for 3-month securities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It has traded in positive territory since October, with the exception of Tuesday's brief inversion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The curve between 2-year and 10-year notes, which is also watched as a recession indicator, inverted for the first time since 2007 in August. It has been positive since early September.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(GRAPHIC: Yield curve inversions typically precede recessions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4686/4648/Inversion210.png) </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHY DOES INVERSION MATTER?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yield curve inversion is a classic signal of a looming recession. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession in the past 50 years. It offered a false signal just once in that time.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When short-term yields climb above longer-dated ones, it signals short-term borrowing costs are more expensive than longer-term loan costs. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under these circumstances, companies often find it more expensive to fund their operations, and executives tend to temper or shelve investments. Consumer borrowing costs also rise and consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slows.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The economy eventually contracts and unemployment rises.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHY DOES THE CURVE INVERT AT ALL?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shorter-dated securities are highly sensitive to interest rate policy set by a central bank such as the U.S. Federal Reserve.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Longer-dated securities are more influenced by investors' expectations for future inflation because inflation is anathema to bond holders.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So, when the Fed is raising rates, as it did for three years, that pushes up yields on shorter-dated bonds at the front of the curve. And when future inflation is seen as contained, as it is now because higher borrowing costs are expected to become a drag on the economy, investors are willing to accept relatively modest yields on long-dated bonds at the back end of the curve.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Karen Brettell and Dan Burns; Editing by Megan Davies and Lisa Shumaker)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Policymakers have said that buying will continue “at least into” the second quarter of 2020, but the pace of those purchases and how quickly they will slow remains a wild card.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed began snapping up securities after a tumultuous episode in money markets last year. The central bank had just <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/business/fed-bonds-economy.html" title="">stopped shrinking its holdings</a> of Treasury securities when, in September, a key short-term rate jumped out of whack.

While that effort is temporary, bill purchases are a longer-lived fix. The two programs added about $400 billion to the central bank’s holdings in the second half of 2019.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the Fed prepares to tiptoe away from bill-buying in particular, it is creating a tense moment for Wall Street. Stock prices have risen on the back of the purchases, and analysts warn that the gains could fade as buying slows.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That will take away some of the fuel that has probably been able to help the markets out,” said Joseph Kalish, chief global macro strategist at Ned Davis Research, a market research firm.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chair Jerome H. Powell is widely expected to field questions about the Fed’s plans at a news conference after its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The meeting itself is expected to produce little drama — the Fed is likely to leave rates unchanged — but Mr. Powell’s comments about the purchases could generate headlines and roil markets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fed officials took pains to clarify from the start that the Treasury bill purchases were simply a technical fix aimed at lifting the amount of bank reserves in the financial system. The multibillion-dollar effort was not, they insisted, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/business/economy/federal-reserve-treasury-bills.html" title="">the same as the “quantitative easing” bond-buying programs</a> it periodically undertook after the financial crisis to aid economic growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nobody in financial markets cared what it was called. To them, it was a reason to buy stocks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The market doesn’t really discriminate between what’s causing the balance sheet to expand,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, an investment strategy consulting firm. “If it’s expanding, it’s bullish.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is not conclusive that the Fed’s expanding balance sheet — its portfolio of financial holdings — has been driving market gains.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some economists doubt the merits of that explanation. (The gains also coincided with an easing of trade tensions between the United States and China.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there is a widespread narrative that the program is helping stocks, which makes any signal about its future crucial for investors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s about how he delivers the message,” said Seth Carpenter, chief United States economist at UBS. “They have a decided incentive to give as much guidance as they can, just to set expectations early.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 10 percent since the Fed’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191011a.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Oct. 11 announcement</a> — a climb that was remarkably steady before an outbreak of the coronavirus in China <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/stock-market-today.html" title="">set off a recent return of volatility</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The purchases were among the Fed’s actions that helped drive outsize returns across financial markets last year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After raising rates four times in 2018, Mr. Powell’s central bank suddenly swiveled away from plans for further increases in the face of tumbling stock markets, signs of global economic weakness and tepid inflation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed instead ended up cutting rates three times last year, moves widely credited as a key driver of the stock market’s 28.9 percent gain.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if recent history is any guide, the growth of the Fed’s balance sheet could have played an important, if less transparent, role in the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/business/2019-markets.html" title="">rally of virtually every financial market last year</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The central bank began large-scale buying Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities in March 2009, the same month that the bull run for stocks began. When the Fed tried in 2010 to pause that program — known as quantitative easing — stocks slumped until it became clear that the Fed would restart its buying.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another momentary end to bond-buying in 2011 also coincided with a rocky run for the S&amp;P 500. But a third-round of quantitative easing in late 2012 helped supercharge stocks. The S&amp;P 500 rocketed up by a combined 44 percent in 2013 and 2014.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed’s balance sheet has narrowed slightly to $4.15 trillion since the beginning of the year as its repo injections became smaller. That program was always seen as temporary, so its slowing does not create the same potential for market disruption as the bill purchases, analysts say.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eventually, the central bank plans to stop the larger-scale purchases and expand its holdings just in line with the broader economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the exact timing, and the balance sheet’s ultimate size, are anyone’s guess.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Carpenter at UBS expects the Fed to continue buying $60 billion into March before tapering off those purchases. Bank of America analysts expect the Fed will carry on buying $60 billion in Treasury bills through June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But they note that “risks are skewed” toward slower purchases. Either way could matter to markets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Fed balance sheet growth has likely supported the recent risk rally, but is unlikely the dominant driver, in our view,” the Bank of American analysts wrote.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To be clear, no one is sure of the exact mechanism by which the growth of the Fed’s balance sheet pushes stocks up. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But for investors, the basic point is that over the last decade the market adage “don’t fight the Fed” has been one of the most effective bits of investment advice available. When the Fed was buying, investors had better be, too.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The flip side, of course, is that markets have grown acutely sensitive to any indication that the Fed would shrink the bank’s balance sheet. In 2018, as the Fed lifted interest rates four times while reducing the size of the balance sheet, an across-the-board sell-off of stocks, bonds and commodities followed suit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And perhaps the most famous example of this dynamic hit the markets in May 2013, after then-Fed Chair Ben S. Bernanke hinted in congressional testimony that the Fed could start to cut back on its bond-buying programs sooner than many had expected. The markets panicked, with stock and bond markets selling off simultaneously.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed is faced with a similar, if less dramatic, communication challenge this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If the market perception is that the Fed is pouring in liquidity and that’s boosting asset prices, once they start to pare back these Treasury purchases and or the overall sizes of the repo operations, it could be that the markets throw a bit of a tantrum,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief United States financial economist at Oxford Economics.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Gavin Newsom participated in the count in San Diego, where he lauded volunteers for “stepping up and being part of the solution.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year, the counts took place against the backdrop of a housing emergency that has reshaped life across the Golden State and dominated the attention of policymakers at every level.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the Echo Park neighborhood of L.A., near where I live, tensions had been rising over an encampment in a grassy clearing on the northern edge of Echo Park Lake. Though city officials have said the area needs to be cleaned, residents and activists have said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/1/24/21080449/homeless-camp-echo-park-lake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">unpredictable sweeps and citations</a> are really meant to push the unhoused out of a public space.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the volunteers said they were planning to join residents of the encampment in a protest the next morning. The count, they said, was an important way of ensuring officials confront the full scope of homelessness in their communities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More broadly, volunteers told me it was the magnitude of the crisis they saw every day that moved them to spend four hours of their evenings looking for people sleeping in alleys or doorways and counting tents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ceraun Loggins, 29, told me they moved from Washington, D.C., in April. They bike to work, and seeing the number of people living on the streets, they said, “was a punch to the gut.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Joining the count seemed like a simple way to help.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s like one of these invisible mechanisms,” they said. “You don’t think about how it has to happen.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the short video, there was a mildly chaotic shuffle as the volunteers broke into groups of two to four. Each team was assigned a census tract. Some were walkable. Some, tucked higher into the hills, required a car.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority gathers more specific demographic information about who is experiencing homelessness in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=3461-2019-homeless-count-demographic-survey.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a separate survey</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time, though, we were told to count visually — not to engage.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I tagged along with a group of four, all in our 20s or 30s. We walked to our narrow rectangle tract, which was lined by quiet apartment buildings set back above the street.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We saw a woman rifle through a trash can before continuing down the sidewalk. She nodded at us and said something quietly as she passed. We nodded back but didn’t ask where she was headed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A member of our group, Chloe English, 29, made a mark on the form.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Well, we got a grand total of one,” she said at the end of our route. She paused. “It’s a nice thing we only encountered one.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of course, in another tract, that most likely would have been different.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, I was struck by how the task felt mundane, and enormous at the same time: There aren’t people living in their cars or sleeping outside on every block in L.A. County. But someone has to check every block to know.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Sunday morning, I visited the encampment by the lake at the center of the protest. Residents sat outside their tents and chatted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I asked Jasmine Martinez, a 33-year-old Angeleno who said she’s lived in the camp for about four months, whether she’d heard anything about the point-in-time count. She hadn’t.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Martinez said she had been spending her time struggling to navigate the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/28/upshot/administrative-burden-quiz.html" title="">labyrinth of services</a> available to people experiencing homelessness. She was seeking therapy and trying to access housing vouchers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the meantime, she said, she felt safe in the park — safer than she did on Skid Row or in shelters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Here, we have a family,” she said. “A lot of us are growing up on our own.”</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-42fcec18">Here’s what else we’re following</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Experts don’t yet know how contagious, or how deadly, this new virus is. But the growing crisis has inspired panic. Cities around the world are bracing for a potential wave of infections. Stock and oil prices are tumbling. And experts in just about every global industry are fretting over the many supply chains that could be disrupted — from prescription drugs and surgical masks to rare earth metals — if the outbreak grows into an even wider epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given the scope of these anxieties, it’s a wonder more hasn’t been done to prepare for an outbreak like this one. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have long warned that the rate at which new pathogens emerge is increasing (partly as a result of global warming). The agency identifies new ones every year, and disease outbreaks — especially those involving viruses that leap from animals to humans, as the coronavirus did — are hardly surprising.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China, the center of the current outbreak, appears to have learned at least some lessons from the last such crisis it confronted. In 2002, when SARS first emerged, the country’s leaders waited roughly three months before notifying the World Health Organization. By then, the virus was on its way to reaching more than a dozen countries. (SARS is also caused by a coronavirus, variants of which are fairly common around the world but rarely affect humans. When they do, they generally cause upper-respiratory infections.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese officials appear to have moved much faster this time around. They alerted the W.H.O. within a month of detecting the first coronavirus cases and moved quickly to sequence the new virus and to contain it: Some <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/opinion/china-wuhan-virus-quarantine.html" title="">56 million people</a>, including the entire city of Wuhan, have been placed under quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But global health experts say that over all, the country’s response still leaves much to be desired. Officials appear to have withheld <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">crucial information</a> — including that the virus was spreading between humans and that cases were not confined to the elderly or to people who visited the market believed to be at the outbreak’s epicenter — for weeks. They have also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/29/officials-praise-china-transparency-virus-108926" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">rebuffed</a> initial offers of help from the C.D.C. and failed to share samples of the virus with the scientific community.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Global health experts are already cautioning other countries to prepare for China’s containment efforts to fail. Part of the problem is that a quarantine of this size is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/opinion/china-wuhan-virus-quarantine.html" title="">inherently difficult</a> to maintain. Another major issue is a lack of public trust: Control measures work only if people abide by them. And people are much less likely to follow orders when they don’t trust that the authorities issuing them have their best interests at heart. In Wuhan and elsewhere in China, trust in officials is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html" title="">running low</a>, as some citizens <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html" title="">suspect</a> that the government is more concerned with containing bad press than with defeating the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In fact, trust may prove at least as important as technology and financial resources in keeping the coronavirus outbreak at bay — as global health workers learned during <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/opinion/ebola-epidemic-congo.html" title="">recent Ebola outbreaks</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">American officials ought to keep that hard-learned lesson in mind. President Trump said after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States that the outbreak is “totally under control.” (Since then, such cases have been confirmed in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">at least five people in four states</a>.) One would like to believe the president’s pronouncements. But Mr. Trump has a history of obscuring facts — especially scientific ones — to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/us/politics/trump-alabama-dorian.html" title="">score political points</a>. Scientists and the public are right to worry about the potential consequences of such duplicity. What happens if people stop trusting the institutions meant to protect them from natural disasters, faulty medical products or disease outbreaks? If the coronavirus proves especially contagious or deadly, that question will no longer be hypothetical.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nor will the consequences of an “America First” worldview that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153264/rise-right-wing-nationalism-jeopardizing-world-health" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">treats global health security as unnecessary</a>. In only three years, the Trump administration has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-coronavirus-has-landed-in-the-us-heres-how-we-can-reduce-the-risk/2020/01/22/afebe9ee-3d53-11ea-baca-eb7ace0a3455_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">eliminated</a> the office of pandemic response, created after the Ebola epidemic of 2014; drastically scaled back the C.D.C.’s overseas <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-ebola-disease-cuts-global-health-security-agenda.html" title="">outbreak prevention efforts</a>, from 49 countries to just 10; and discontinued a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html" title="">surveillance program</a> meant to detect new viral threats, like the coronavirus, before they make the leap into humans.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To its credit, the administration has managed to keep some of the world’s leading infectious disease experts in key roles at top agencies, including the C.D.C., the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. If those professionals are given the resources and authority to respond to the crisis as their experience and the science dictate — if they are empowered to develop vaccines, deploy experts and collaborate with response teams in affected regions — the worst-case scenarios may yet be averted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One hopes that will be the case. If so, the United States and the rest of the world will do well to learn from this experience. It will almost certainly not be the last time the world faces such a crisis.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

We’ve seen this story before, as health authorities working with threadbare data try to walk the line between epidemic readiness and needless panic. Is this new outbreak poised to become the next AIDS pandemic or a new SARS, which was stopped in its tracks after 774 deaths? To cut through the headlines, we can use a simple concept called the “epidemic triangle.” Employed by epidemiologists since the discipline’s earliest days, it is indispensable in predicting whether localized outbreaks will transform into full-blown epidemics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The epidemic triangle is essentially an equation. It posits that every outbreak, regardless of its specific traits, is dependent on the interplay between three factors: the pathogen (the agent causing infection), the host (the organism at risk of infection) and the environment (the setting where the infections occur). Every single epidemic — be it the flu, cholera or even behavioral epidemics like drunken driving — is the result of a dynamic shift in one of these points of the epidemic triangle, which then causes a domino effect leading to a sudden explosion of new cases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In one classic example of this phenomenon, we have an environmental shift to thank for the emergence of the global flu pandemic. In the mid-16th century, ducks were introduced to Chinese rice paddies to feed on the insects that were destroying crops. That meant ducks joined another common feature of Chinese farms: pigs. The duck’s unique biology makes it a generous reservoir for a vast number of viruses, while pigs are uncannily efficient at mixing different viruses together into new strains and passing them to humans. Breeding these two animals in proximity quickly led to the combination and transmission of new viral strains. Novel and highly virulent pathogens — hybrid pig-duck influenza strains — then crossed the species barrier and have been tormenting humanity ever since.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The family of coronaviruses (so-called because they resemble glowing crowns) that includes the new Wuhan strain are exceptionally challenging to control. Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold, pneumonia and bronchitis, but the coronavirus family is sprawling and includes deadlier outliers like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which have fatality rates of up to 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The big question, then, is whether the Wuhan coronavirus is closer to the common cold or to SARS. While its case fatality rate is unknown, as of Wednesday there were more 6,000 confirmed cases worldwide (with about 80 outside of mainland China) and at least 130 people dead. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, the World Health Organization convened a special committee to decide whether to declare a global health emergency. Ultimately, after two days of deliberation, the group decided not to take this major step, though the W.H.O.’s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted ominously that “it may yet become one.” That time may have come: Today, the W.H.O. committee <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-panel-to-reconvene-on-thursday-to-decide-if-virus-global-emergency-2020-01-29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">will convene again</a> to determine if the outbreak has crossed a threshold into warranting a designation of a global emergency. As it considers how to proceed, the W.H.O. committee is grappling with a monumental choice — global health emergencies are legally binding announcements requiring every United Nations member state to take action — with scant data.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I don’t doubt that the epidemic triangle is critical in helping W.H.O. navigate this process. Is this outbreak because of a substantive shift in the genetic makeup of an old pathogen, a change in the vulnerability of the host population or an alteration of the environment that has shaped the threat emanating from Wuhan? As the Wuhan outbreak continues to expand, applying the calculus of the epidemic triangle remains the most reliable way to chart an effective public health response while avoiding a descent into hysteria.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, we need to know how much of a shift this new pathogen is from previous coronavirus strains, based on its infective potential and virulence. Judging from the rapid rise in cases since the first cluster was reported on Dec. 31, the new Wuhan strain could very well be highly infective. For perspective, SARS has a relatively low basic reproductive ratio (or R0) of 0.5, meaning that every two cases of SARS results in only one additional infection. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Very early estimates</a> shared by the W.H.O. suggest the Wuhan strain’s R0 is 1.4 to 2.5, producing roughly two secondary cases for each initial infection, which places it slightly higher than the seasonal flu (for perspective, measles has a R0 of 12 to 18).</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If the new coronavirus’s R0 remains low as more data become available, we can be relatively confident that surveillance and quarantine will stem its spread, though these measures become steadily less effective as the R0 increases. With respect to its virulence, early genomic sequencing of the Wuhan virus suggests, thankfully, that it is only distantly related to SARS (they are only 73 percent identical), meaning that it is likely to be less deadly, though it is too early to say with confidence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, we have to ask how this outbreak might be explained by a shift in the vulnerability of its host (human beings). What scientists will be looking for here is an indication that those who have died are older or immune-compromised, consistent with the fatalities we see from other common coronavirus infections.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That leaves the environment, the last point of the epidemic triangle — and this is where things get complicated. As China’s economy has expanded, the number of Chinese citizens taking to the skies has risen astronomically. Much has been made about this week’s Lunar New Year celebration, and rightly so: it is the world’s largest human migration, with as many as three billion planned trips by car, train and plane within China over a two-week period. The challenges of quarantining during this migration are staggering, though China is better equipped than most countries to carry out draconian public health measures, and has demonstrated its resolve by imposing a lockdown on travel for — at last count — more than 50 million of its citizens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Where the environment has truly shifted, though, is in China’s connections to the rest of the world. In 2005, two years after the first SARS outbreak, there were only 233 international air routes from mainland China. By 2016, international routes had more than tripled to 739, meaning there were far more routes for the virus to take out of the country. During the same period, the number of international air passengers traveling in and out of China exploded from around three million to over 51 million. In short, China’s increasingly outward-facing stance has greatly expanded the environment within which the Wuhan coronavirus can propagate. This, among all three of the points of the epidemic triangle, makes predicting the scope of the current outbreak exceedingly complex.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As we face new epidemic threats, no matter what their origin, we can rely on one constant: Each will ultimately be explained by the interaction of the three points of the epidemic triangle. In the case of the Wuhan coronavirus, what should trouble us the most is the rapid expansion of the environment across which the pathogen can infect its hosts, which maps neatly over China’s emergence as a global superpower. It remains to be seen whether the scale of this change is enough to transform it from a SARS-like scare — a blip in epidemic history — and into the next Spanish flu.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Dan Werb is the author of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/city-of-omens-9781635572995/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">City of Omens: A Search for the Missing Women of the Borderlands</a>,” an assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases and global public health at the University of California, San Diego, and the director of the Center on<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://cdpe.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> Drug Policy Evaluation</a>.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

In one case, he said, a Chinese woman who sneezed at a coffee shop overheard someone whisper that she might have the coronavirus. In another case, a man on the subway watched people walk away from him after he coughed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scott Liu, who lives in Queens, told my colleagues Joseph Goldstein and Jeffrey E. Singer that he was refusing to leave his house. Mr. Liu said he had been on the last direct flight from Wuhan — the Chinese city where the outbreak began — to Kennedy International Airport, before all flights between the two cities were canceled last week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Liu said that he did not believe he was sick, but that he felt responsible to act with caution, even if that meant not visiting his friends and family for Lunar New Year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For us, this is very serious,” Mr. Liu, 56, said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Others, like Lin Qiurong, who emigrated from Fujian Province in China in 2002, said that she ignored messages from her relatives and friends to avoid crowds. This week, Ms. Lin, 40, and her three children put on surgical face masks and headed to a parade in Sunset Park, Brooklyn’s largest Chinatown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Look around,” Ms. Lin said at the parade. “It’s much emptier compared to last year.”</p>, <h3 class="css-1ldy5g8 e1gnsphs0" id="link-18095b0c">The aftermath of the museum archives fire</h3>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 200 firefighters and emergency personnel responded to a blaze at 70 Mulberry Street, the building in Manhattan’s Chinatown where the archives of the Museum of Chinese in America are situated. Nine firefighters were injured in the fire, which started about 8:40 p.m., as well as a 59-year-old man whom they rescued.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The city-owned building hosts several community organizations. The museum’s archives stored 85,000 items that tell the story of Chinese migration and life in the United States, some of which dated to the 19th century. The museum itself is on Centre Street.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yesterday, contractors working with the city recovered almost 200 boxes of the museum’s archives from a second-floor room in the Mulberry Street building. Some of the items suffered no damage. It was unclear when the other rooms would be accessible.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Councilwoman Margaret S. Chin, who represents part of Lower Manhattan, said the Lunar New Year was an opportunity for the Chinese community to show resilience.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’ve gone through a lot in the past,” Ms. Chin said, “but we always manage to come together to rebuild.”</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-62af30bb">From The Times</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/nyregion/nyc-recycling.html" title="">7 Reasons Recycling Isn’t Working in New York City</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/nyregion/homeless-shelters-services-fraud.html" title="">$500 Million for the Homeless Targeted in Scheme With Bogus Addresses</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/nyregion/nxivm-lawsuit-keith-raniere.html" title="">Nxivm ‘Sex Cult’ Was Also a Huge Pyramid Scheme, Lawsuit Says</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-tarale-wulff.html" title="">Weinstein Told an Accuser ‘This Is How the Industry Works,’ She Says</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Want more news? <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/nyregion" title="">Check out our full coverage</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Mini Crossword:</strong> Here is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini" title="">today’s puzzle</a>.</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-783cf870">What we’re reading</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">pregnant woman was pronounced dead</strong> after being shoved from a moving car in Brooklyn.

What? A notice in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/upshot/coronavirus-risk-prevention-advice.html" title="">Chinese</a> said it was locked to prevent the spread of the new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/upshot/coronavirus-risk-prevention-advice.html" title="">coronavirus</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So I headed toward the north entrance. That one is for pedestrians and has two barriers set slightly apart, just wide enough to get through on foot. That’s O.K., I thought, I can squeeze by with my bike and be home in a few minutes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I rode around the block, but when I got to the gate I had to slam on the brakes. Someone had taken a dozen ride-share bikes, lashed them together with wire and piled them in between the barriers. Then, for good measure, they’d fastened the heap to the posts with more wire, making it into some sort of postmodern commentary on our hypermobile society.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Laughing, I rode on to the main entrance. It has a car entrance with a big gate and on either side, walkways for pedestrians. One of those was also piled high with ride-share bikes sacrificed for the national good; the other was protected by two security guards I’d never seen before. They blocked my way.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What do you want?” one of them asked.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“To go home. I live here.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Have you been to Wuhan recently?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I just rode back. I’m exhausted!”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The humor was beyond their pay grade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Is anyone in your home from Wuhan or has been there recently?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I needed to stop fooling around.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“No, I haven’t been there in four years. I live alone. No fever. I feel fine.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They silently let me through.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This felt like the height of foolishness: Why would the gates be open during the day but locked down at night? Do viruses operate like vampires? That’s when I realized the guards’ effort was just part of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Borg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Borg</a>-like lockdown that the state had put into place with the alacrity of officials in full C.Y.A. mode.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The next day I was cleaning my apartment: No one could enter Beijing anymore, so my one luxury, an hour-a-week house cleaner, was stuck in her village even though the main phase of the Lunar New Year holiday was over. There was a knock on my door. It was the good people from the apartment management office, Mrs. Luo and her assistant.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Oh, Mr. Zhang, nice to see you,” Mrs. Luo, the henna-haired manager of lease renewals, said, addressing me by my Chinese name. “Is there anyone from Wuhan in your apartment?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“No. Still not.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“O.K. Take a look at this please.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She handed me a sheet from the local Communist Party district committee, listing dos and don’ts to follow during the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Do seek help. Do listen to the local government. Do keep warm. Do stay at home. Do avoid contact. Do wash your hands. Don’t spit. Don’t exert yourself too much. Don’t associate with people who’ve recently arrived from the infected area around the megacity of Wuhan. On the back was a list of all the Communist Party street committees and their phone numbers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, after five years of living in this neighborhood and countless failed efforts to register my complaints about illegal construction at night, I had some phone numbers. I filed the sheet for future use.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The German language has, as usual, a hyper-specific word for this phenomenon: “Aktionismus,” literally Actionism, or action for action’s sake. What I was witnessing was Aktionismus in the face of a problem that required a sensitive response involving public trust. But since the Chinese government cannot elicit either of those things, I was seeing the compensatory flailing-around of a state with no other options.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead of having an adult conversation with the population about the virus and putting in place reasonable policies that have been used effectively elsewhere, the Chinese state has gone into full lockdown mode. This demonstrates one of those truisms from political science: Authoritarian governments are like people who don’t have any fingers but do possess two thumbs. They can take forceful actions but can’t fine-tune the levers of government.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Actually, I’m not being fair. When the Chinese Communist Party has time, it can come up with and use sophisticated policies — witness <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/opinion/sunday/chinas-religion-xi.html" title="">its co-opting of traditional faiths</a> to fill a spiritual vacuum in society.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But when faced with a crisis, the party can’t seem to avoid grand gestures: building hospitals from scratch in two weeks, locking down tens of millions of people, banning millions more from traveling to big cities and so on. In some ways, a moment like this one is a technocrat’s dream: When Western health care experts say that this sort of lockdown won’t work, they basically mean it’s never been tried on this scale with this kind of uberefficient government.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now that it’s being tried, not just in Beijing but also across the country, the effects are kind of thrilling to watch. Apartment compounds like mine are being fumigated. (With what? Who cares!) People are walking around with loudspeakers blaring out warnings against the virus. Villages are closing their gates as if bandits were on the prowl. And going to a restaurant or a bar is almost an act of treason or, at best, foolish selfishness.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The most interesting question is why the party feels the need to carry on like this. I think it knows the people don’t trust it in these cases and assume there has been a cover-up.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hence one of the most popular figures in the crisis: Zhong Nanshan, the hero of the 2002-3 SARS outbreak, now 83, who is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/23/WS5e28dd3ca310128217272df3.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">back in action</a>, treating patients and warning citizens about the need for hygiene. He has been adopted as the incorruptible official — a familiar trope in Chinese history, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210361-the-green-reed-which-bends-in-the-wind-is-stronger" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Confucian official who stands tall despite pressures to bend</a>. And so we read endless profiles of Dr. Zhong in Chinese social media, discussing his family background, upbringing, successes and apolitical pursuit of science-based truth. The clear implication is that he is that rare official capable of such principled conduct.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Behind all this lies the feeling that most other people in the party can’t quite be trusted. This has been reinforced over the past few days by reports that at least eight people who were detained in Wuhan in early January <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/china-is-arresting-people-for-spreading-rumors-online-about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">on charges of spreading rumors</a> are in fact medical doctors, not fear-mongering ne’er-do-wells. This startling fact is now leaking out in online reports that are sometimes, but not always, being blocked. At some point, the government will have to admit to a partial cover-up.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Considering the underlying distrust, it’s hard for the government to say what many epidemiologists are saying: This outbreak is serious but not catastrophic. Because if the state leveled with the people, it would also have to admit that there is no need for this degree of social control. Some 259 people were reported to have died as of Saturday evening, in a country of nearly 1.4 billion, and there is no indication that we are at the start of a Hollywood disaster-style movie.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government’s inability to formulate a measured response will turn this outbreak into a direct successor of the SARS epidemic. That hardly was a huge public health disaster — fewer than 800 deaths — yet it has taken on a legendary reputation as a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, one that should never be allowed to recur.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But of course a new outbreak has occurred.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Does this mean that the state will suffer? I don’t think so. For despite their mistrust of the system, people over all are going along with the lockdown.

Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration has been waging a global trade war in an attempt to bring jobs back to the United States. That has included steep tariffs on imported goods, which President Trump has wielded as a cudgel to force companies to relocate manufacturing to the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials have said that the first-phase trade deal Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html" title="">signed with China this month</a> would improve ties between the countries. But they also say that their tariffs — which remain in place on more than $360 billion of Chinese products — will cause American companies with Chinese operations to think about moving their supply chains back home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some companies that can move operations out of China have been doing so, in part to avoid the tariffs and in part because of longer-run economic factors, like China’s rising wages. But economists say that few of these factories are moving back to the United States. Instead, competition for factory space in low-wage countries like Vietnam, Mexico and India to make clothes, toys and shoes has been fierce.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And many companies say they are unable to move their supply chains, often because it is too expensive to shift or because China is the primary manufacturer of their materials. For instance, China remains the global hub of electronics manufacturing, and a huge consumer market in its own right.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has placed entire cities under lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and encouraged companies to let their workers stay home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The moves are expected to result in a major dent in the Chinese economy — and are likely spill over to slow global growth. Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said on Wednesday that “there is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and perhaps globally.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html" title="">already caused companies including Apple, Ford and Toyota</a> to reroute supply chains and idle factories in China, while Ikea, Starbucks and other businesses have temporarily closed some Chinese stores. British Airways and Air Canada have suspended all flights to mainland China, while other major airlines have reduced the number of flights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ross, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/dealbook/wilbur-ross-forbes.html" title="">a wealthy investor,</a> has been criticized for making controversial or seemingly out-of-touch statements in televised interviews before. In May 2018, he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/commerce-secretary-ross-claim-that-tariffs-wouldnt-hurt-campbells-soup-just-blew-up.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">held up a can of Campbell’s soup</a> while arguing that the administration’s metal tariffs would have a minimal effect on consumers. In early 2019, he suggested that workers who had been sent home without pay during the government shutdown <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/business/wilbur-ross-shutdown.html" title="">should take out personal loans</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Commerce Department, in an emailed statement, said Mr. Ross had made clear that the first step was to bring the virus under control and help victims of the disease. “It is also important to consider the ramifications of doing business with a country that has a long history of covering up real risks to its own people and the rest of the world,” the statement said.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]
[<p>Advertisement</p>, <p>Supported by</p>, <h1 class="css-1qskr30 e1h9rw200" id="link-54eeec30" itemprop="headline"><span>No, Team Trump, the Coronavirus Isn’t Good for America</span></h1>, <p class="css-1ifw933 e1wiw3jv0" id="article-summary">The commerce secretary just flunked microbe economics.</p>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <a class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman"><span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">Paul Krugman</span></a></p>, <p class="css-cpkn1d e1wtpvyy1">Opinion Columnist</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">How frightened should you be about the coronavirus? I’m no epidemiologist, but what I’ve seen looks pretty scary. It doesn’t help that the Trump administration, as part of its general war against science and expertise, has seriously reduced America’s capacity to respond if we do face a dangerous pandemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It also looks quite possible that the virus will inflict a lot of economic damage — even if it doesn’t kill you, it might kill your job. And one special source of concern is that top officials in the Trump administration are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/30/wilbur-ross-coronavirus-jobs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">talking nonsense</a> about the economic threat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So, about that economic threat: Many people are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/coronavirus-china-economic-impact.html" title="">drawing parallels</a> between the coronavirus and the 2002-3 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also originated in China. Like the current outbreak, SARS led to the imposition of economically disruptive quarantines, which appear to have had a significant if temporary adverse effect on China’s economy, and a modest negative impact on the world economy as a whole.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We still don’t know whether the coronavirus is more or less dangerous than SARS. What we do know is that the global economic implications of a pandemic in China are likely to be much more severe now than they were then, for the simple reason that China is a vastly bigger player than it used to be.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2002 China was still in the early stages of its great economic surge; it accounted for only around <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42135.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">8 percent</a> of global manufacturing value added, far less than the shares of the U.S., Japan and Europe. Today, however, China is the workshop of the world, accounting for more than a quarter of global manufacturing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, you might think that this implies an upside to China’s troubles, that disrupting China’s vast manufacturing sector would offer opportunities to producers in other countries, including the United States. That is, you might think this if you knew nothing about 21st-century economics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sure enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on Fox Business on Thursday morning to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/30/wilbur-ross-coronavirus-jobs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">declare</a> that he “didn’t want to talk about a victory lap,” but that the coronavirus “will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.” By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail Collins’s readers voted him Trump’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/trump-cabinet-wilbur-ross.html" title="">worst cabinet member</a>, and (2) why Trump’s trade war has been such a failure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What Ross and his colleagues apparently still don’t understand — although some of them may be getting an inkling — is that modern manufacturing isn’t like manufacturing a couple of generations ago, when different countries’ industrial sectors were engaged in fairly straightforward head-to-head competition. These days we live in a world of global value chains, in which much of what any given nation imports consists not of consumer goods but of “intermediate” goods that it uses as part of its own production process.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In such a world, anything that disrupts imports — whether it’s tariffs or a virus — raises production costs, and as a result if anything hurts manufacturing. Indeed, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">recent study</a> by the Federal Reserve found that Trump’s tariffs, which were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/measuring-trumps-2018-trade-protection-five-takeaways" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">concentrated</a> on intermediate goods, have reduced, not increased, manufacturing output and employment. Sure enough, while overall economic growth in 2019 was decent (not great), manufacturing is in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/upshot/economy-in-a-nutshell-manufacturing-in-recession-services-booming.html" title="">recession</a>. (And the uncertainty created by the trade war may explain why business investment is down despite a huge cut in corporate taxes.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As I said, some of Trump’s people seem to have gotten an inkling here. Last week the White House <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ChadBown/status/1221823022618894336" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">basically admitted</a> that tariffs on steel and aluminum have done more harm than good, hurting industries that use these materials. But the administration’s answer isn’t a reconsideration of its policies — it is to impose more tariffs, on a wider range of products.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Which brings me back to the coronavirus. Let’s leave aside the public health issues — although the Trump administration has clearly left us much less prepared than we had been to deal with these issues if they become serious — and focus on the economics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What we can say is that if the virus seriously disrupts Chinese production, its impact on the U.S. economy will be like an extreme version of Trump’s trade war, except without any compensation in the form of tariff revenue. And the two things we know about the trade war are that it has been an economic bust and that Trump’s officials still appear clueless about why it has been a bust.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bear in mind that so far Trump has been remarkably lucky. Aside from Hurricane Maria — which he mishandled, and in which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/politics/trump-fact-check-hurricane.html" title="">thousands of Americans died</a> — he has faced essentially no crises, domestic or foreign, that weren’t of his own making. And he has surrounded himself with the gang that couldn’t think straight, which raises severe doubts about how well he would handle a crisis that he didn’t create himself.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If Wilbur Ross’s boneheaded remarks on Thursday are any indication — and I fear they are — the Trump administration is even less prepared to deal with the economic fallout from a possible pandemic than it is to deal with the public health crisis.

That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And act decisively they did — not against the virus, but against whistle-blowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/YaxueCao/status/1221769811858010112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was disciplined</a> by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-information-crackdown-on-wuhan-coronavirus-2020-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The police reported</a> giving “education” and “criticism” to eight front-line doctors for “rumormongering” about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus-social-media.html" title="">kept its own citizens in the dark</a>; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://qz.com/1791611/wuhan-coronavirus-chinese-people-channel-anger-through-chernobyl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">joked grimly</a> about a “patriotic” virus that only struck foreigners.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan’s mayor said he wasn’t authorized to discuss the virus until late this month. In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and didn’t take precautions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Partly because the government covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able to gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and protective gear. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/27china-coronavirus-health.html" title="">Some doctors were reduced</a> to making goggles out of plastic folders.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi’s China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental organizations, the legal profession and others that might provide accountability. These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and off they were tolerated until Xi came along.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I conducted <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/opinion/23kristof.html" title="">a series of experiments</a> on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised by what I could get away with — but no longer. Xi has dragged China backward in terms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the same reason that Xi’s increasingly authoritarian China bungled the coronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine fever virus that since 2018 has devastated China’s hog industry and killed almost <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/china-swine-fever.html" title="">one-quarter of the world’s pigs</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dictators often make poor decisions because they don’t get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you. Senior Chinese officials have told me that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must dispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real mood.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes. He mishandled and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the re-election of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over worsening relations with the United States and many other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The coronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, and one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is confining about one million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health care.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Viruses are challenges for any country, and it’s only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does. It’s a credit to China’s system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United States, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than Cambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, with a dose of humility, let’s get over any misplaced admiration some Americans have for Xi’s authoritarian model.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese social contract has been that citizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet China’s economy is now as weak as it has been in three decades — and the coronavirus will sap growth further.

Doctors racing to the scene. Confusion and fear spreading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For more than 12 hours on Thursday, the travelers aboard a ship docked north of Rome were ensnared in what was an ultimately false alarm after a Chinese national came down with a fever.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The episode prompted by a single sick passenger illustrates the fear that is spreading around the world along with the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html" title="">sickened nearly 9,800 people globally, the vast majority of them in mainland China.</a> All 213 deaths have been reported in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For much of the day, Italy was gripped by fears that the coronavirus had arrived in the country. At least 68 cases have been reported outside mainland China, but there had not yet been any confirmed cases in Italy — though that changed later Thursday, when the government announced the first two cases, which were unrelated to the ship.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Giuseppe Ippolito, scientific director of the Spallanzani Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases, said late Thursday that the two confirmed coronavirus cases, two Chinese tourists visiting Rome, were being held in isolation at the hospital.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They were put in isolation as soon as the diagnosis was verified,” he said at a late night news conference with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Health Minister Roberto Speranza.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The officials offered reassurances that they would investigate the movements of the two Chinese tourists and attempt to identify those they may have been in contact with, “to absolutely avoid any further risks,” the prime minister said.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Conte said that Italy had blocked all flights to and from China. “As far as I know we are the first country in Europe to adopt such a precautionary measure,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The scare on the cruise ship began Thursday morning after Italian health officials stopped passengers from leaving the ship, the Costa Smeralda, when it landed in the port town of Civitavecchia on the western Italian coast.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The ship, carrying 5,023 passengers and 1,628 crew, was part of the way through a seven-day cruise, with stops in Italy, France and Spain. It left the Spanish port of Palma de Majorca and arrived at 8 a.m. Thursday in Civitavecchia. More than 1,143 guests had planned to end their cruise on Thursday, but were prevented from disembarking.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later Thursday, a health ministry task force that Italy instituted to counter the spreading virus announced that tests on the passengers for the coronavirus were negative. Italian maritime health authorities said that passengers were allowed to disembark.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Costa Cruises said in a statement Thursday night that passengers who wished to disembark from the ship could, while passengers who wished to remain onboard would be accommodated and could begin their return home Friday. The ship will remain docked in Civitavecchia until Friday evening, skipping the port of La Spezia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company apologized for the inconvenience but said they had acted to “ensure maximum safety for all our guests, crew and the community as a whole.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Onboard the Costa Smeralda, reactions swung wildly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maria Cartagena, a passenger on the ship, said that the situation on board “was tranquil.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They are doing checks on 2 Chinese passengers and for now (logical) they don’t tell us anything else,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/MariaCartagen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">she wrote on Twitter.</a> “Kind of stressful.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other passengers took to social media to vent concerns and frustrations and share photographs from onboard the ship.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The all-clear came after controls were carried out by experts from the Spallanzani hospital. It is part of a coronavirus task force, which includes health, transportation and civil protection agency officials, which the health ministry set up earlier this month for just such an event.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Civitavecchia, some passengers waiting to board the Costa Smeralda were scared about what awaited them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graziana Iuso, 39, from the southern Italian town of Torremaggiore, said she was nervous.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t want to get on that boat,” she said as she waited to board. “A couple of hours is not enough to do checkups.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another woman who was set to board the ship for a vacation, Antonella Libardo, the owner of a pizzeria in Puglia, said she trusted the company and would board without hesitation if the authorities gave passengers the green light.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This virus thing is becoming a psychosis,” she said.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Emma Bubola reported from Civitavecchia and Elisabetta Povoledo and Jason Horowitz from Rome.

Mentioning those cases, Dr. Tedros said the potential for further global spread was one of the reasons he had called on the W.H.O.’s emergency committee to meet again on Thursday to decide whether to declare the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern.

Davis Lin and Mike Benoist</h3>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s Thursday, January 30.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well, we started hearing reports in early January that there was this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in central China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a mystery virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">People were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which scientists were calling a coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead to pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals, things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty small problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been infected and that, of those, only about four had died.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was treatable and that things would be O.K.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was happening.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations like this?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000 people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it comes to public health.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they needed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so what do you do?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks, enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Once I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him because he was challenging the official narrative about what was happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what was happening to his posts once they went online?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did he tell you?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions, that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">This is the moment when the world begins to wake up.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">That are doing surveillance.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It is. It’s growing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The number of people who have died —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll climbing once again overnight.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">26 deaths so far from the —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— has now passed 40.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yeah.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Are you anxious?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">I mean, understandably.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And then the very next day, I hear —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">What do you mean?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Why?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, thank you.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thanks, Michael.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"> That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If China can somehow contain its outbreak, and if other countries with cases can prevent sustained transmission, Dr. Fauci said that it might be possible to end the outbreak, just as the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003 was stamped out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But it’s going to be a real kind of tightrope walk, because if it gets so expansive then it’s not going to just disappear the way SARS did,” he said. “I think the next four to five weeks are going to be critical. It’s either going to start peaking and go into a downturn, or it’s going to explode into a global outbreak.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview that he thought it would become clear in a few days whether the outbreak could be contained.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If we’re seeing widespread transmission, thousands or tens of thousands of infections in the community, I don’t see how this gets controlled,” Dr. Frieden said. “On the other hand, if we see a SARS-like situation, where with incredible effort they were able to isolate people, tamp down the spread, then we’re in a containment situation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A particular concern is the possibility that the virus could wreak havoc in Africa, where possible cases are being investigated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are very concerned about Africa because some of the least prepared countries for outbreaks are in Africa,” Dr. Frieden said, adding, “We know the systems there to find it and stop it are weaker there than elsewhere.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If efforts to contain an outbreak fail, public health authorities will focus on “mitigation”— dealing with the disease and trying to minimize the harm it does to people and communities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s a worrisome situation in China,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in an interview on Wednesday. “It seems like more of a mitigation strategy than a control strategy that China has moved to.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States still has a chance to avoid China’s fate, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We still only have five cases, and we can really do aggressive measures around those cases,” Dr. Messonnier said. “We’re trying to contain the disease, and by being aggressive we’re hoping to learn more about what it takes to contain it.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The five patients have hundreds of contacts. Some are being tested for the virus, and the results may help researchers understand how the disease is transmitted. The C.D.C. is also monitoring more than 100 “patients under investigation” — some with cough or fever who have been to Wuhan, or have had contact with a patient.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if the case count were to increase exponentially, Dr. Messonnier said, it would be hard to continue the concerted containment efforts. The C.D.C. is already gearing up should the approach need to evolve to mitigation strategies like closing schools, preventing public gatherings and helping hospitals prepare for a surge of cases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One troubling question is whether infected people can start spreading the virus before they themselves get sick. Chinese health officials have said they believe such transmission has taken place. If it happened often, it could make stopping an outbreak much harder.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reason is that the first step in halting outbreaks has traditionally been to identify people who are ill and then stop them from infecting others, usually by isolating them. But that approach will not work as well if people without any symptoms are already transmitting the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials in the United States said they had not seen data from China to support that claim, nor any evidence that people without symptoms had spread the disease in the United States. The five patients in the United States had all visited Wuhan, and so far none of their contacts have become ill or tested positive for the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Fauci said that epidemics are fueled by people with symptoms — like sneezing and coughing, which help spray the virus around — and not by those without symptoms, even if some of them can spread the virus. Dr. Frieden said if asymptomatic people do transmit some virus, sick patients are likely to spread a lot more.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People with colds or flu can spread viruses for a day or two before they become ill, but how big a role that plays in outbreaks is not known, researchers say.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In any case, flu spreads worldwide every year, infecting tens of millions of people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the spread of the new coronavirus is starting to resemble that of seasonal flu, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think we have to revisit which model we’re really using, and I think we really over the past week and a half have come closer to the influenza model,” Dr. Osterholm said. “Trying to stop influenza in a community without vaccine is like trying to stop the wind. I don’t know how we’re going to stop this.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, “The only thing operating in our favor is at least it doesn’t appear to be as severe as SARS or as MERS.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among patients with the Wuhan coronavirus, about 20 percent have become seriously ill, and the rest have a mild illness, the W.H.O. said at a news briefing on Wednesday. So far, the death rate appears to be about 2 percent, but that is not certain yet. Those who die tend to be older people with underlying ailments. The median age of the first 425 patients in China was 59, and a little more than half were male, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://cdf.nejm.org/services/GetOnlineFirstPDF.aspx?DOI=NEJMoa2001316" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to a report published</a> in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Diseases caused by related coronaviruses are deadlier: SARS killed 10 percent, and MERS about 35 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if the new virus were to spread even more widely and a 2 percent mortality rate continued, the death toll could be considerable. Seasonal flu, with a much lower overall death rate of 0.1 percent, kills more than half a million people worldwide every year. At least 8,200 people in the United States have died during this flu season, according to<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> estimates from the C.D.C.</a></p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Roni Caryn Rabin contributed reporting for this article.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Since then, there have been thousands of new cases in China and clear evidence of human-to-human transmission <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html" title="">in several other countries</a>, including the United States. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All of which warranted a reconsideration by the W.H.O.’s emergency committee, officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The declaration “is not a vote of no confidence in China,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director-general. “On the contrary, the W.H.O. continues to have confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The declaration comes now, he said, because of fears that the coronavirus may reach countries with weak health care systems, where it could run amok, potentially infecting millions of people and killing thousands.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Following the declaration, the State Department on Thursday night <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">warned travelers to avoid China altogether</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said that the country “is fully confident and capable of winning the battle against this epidemic.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement on the ministry’s website, she added that China was willing to continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to safeguard public health.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The W.H.O.’s declaration — officially called a “public health emergency of international concern” — does not have the force of law.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The agency is governed by an annual convocation of the health ministers of all U.N. countries, and its role is only to offer advice.

Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">States of emergency are “merely guidance,” said Dr. David L. Heymann, a former W.H.O. assistant director-general who now analyzes the work of the agency’s emergency committee. Governments and even private companies “may or may not follow it.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nonetheless, emergency declarations signal that the world’s top health advisory body thinks the situation is grave. Many scientific experts welcomed the decision. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The public health emergency “allows them to further lean into the role of global leadership for governments and the private sector,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a veteran of several global health emergencies. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first goal, he said, should be to understand more about how the virus is spreading — whether mostly in hospitals and clinics, what ages and sexes or professions are most affected, how sick they become and what risk factors are dangerous.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Amir Attaran, a professor of law and epidemiology at the University of Ottawa and a frequent W.H.O. critic, called the declaration “inexcusably late.” The committee’s reasoning that it lacked enough scientific evidence to declare an emergency last week was “balderdash,” he added. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“W.H.O. is paralyzed for the same political reasons that ruined its scientific judgment in SARS, Ebola and Zika,” he said. “Borders are closed, aircraft grounded and ships anchored as W.H.O. mutely dithers over whether or not to declare an emergency.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Events have comprehensively overtaken them, proving their uselessness yet again,” he added. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Declaring emergencies is always a hard decision, Dr. Tedros said on Wednesday.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Border closings and flight cancellations may cause hardships for millions of healthy people near the epicenter, and enormous economic disruption.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the worst cases, supplies of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/no-food-crowded-hospitals-wuhan-first-week-in-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">food and medicine can run short</a> and panic can spread, threatening to do more damage than the disease.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts at the W.H.O. have lavishly and repeatedly praised China’s response as remarkably aggressive. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The country is building two hospitals, in just two weeks, to house coronavirus patients. Chinese scientists deposited the genetic signature of the coronavirus in public databases, greatly speeding the development of diagnostic tests and, potentially, vaccines.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese authorities cordoned off the major cities at the outbreak’s epicenter, Hubei Province, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/479733-more-than-30-million-on-lockdown-amid-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">stranding more than 50 million people</a> at the height of the Lunar New Year holidays — a measure that few other countries could have undertaken. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whether that massive cordon will prove effective remains to be seen. Five million people were able to leave Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began, before its train and bus stations and airports were closed, the mayor said. There were soon outbreaks across the country. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tedros praised the Chinese government, saying it “is setting a new standard for outbreak response.” Other countries should be grateful that only 98 of the nearly 10,000 cases confirmed so far have occurred outside China’s borders, he said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the emergency declaration, and despite the State Department’s urging Americans to stay away from China, the W.H.O. opposes restrictions on travel to China or on trade with it. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Measures the agency considers unwarranted include border closures, visa restrictions and the quarantining of apparently healthy visitors from the affected regions, said the chairman of the agency’s emergency committee, Dr. Didier Houssin, an adviser to France’s national health security agency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many such measures have already been taken against China by other countries, and Dr. Houssin said the W.H.O. would question the scientific rationales behind them. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neither he nor Dr. Tedros questioned the decision by the United States and other countries to evacuate their citizens from China, and they said the cancellation of flights by airlines was justified if the real reason was that they had no passengers. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tedros, who met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday, said he was struck by how much Mr. Xi knew about the outbreak and by the fact that Ma Xiaowei, director of China’s National Health Commission, was on the ground in Wuhan leading the response. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That is not say there haven’t been missteps. The W.H.O. last week described its risk assessment for the outbreak as “moderate,” when it should have said “high.” The error was corrected in a footnote to the agency’s report; Dr. Tedros described it on Twitter as a “human error.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts in the United States have complained of spotty epidemiological information from China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also, the W.H.O. cannot share information with Taiwan, which now has eight coronavirus patients, because Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The agency “doesn’t want to upset its major stakeholders,” said Charles Clift, a senior consulting fellow at the Chatham House, an international affairs research group in London. “China carries the political clout that other countries don’t.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the outbreak seems to accelerating, along with its consequences. China said on Friday<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>that another 43 people had died from the disease, bringing the total to 213. No deaths have yet occurred outside China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, Russia closed much of its 2,600-mile border with China and stopped all train service between the countries, except for a regular train between Moscow and Beijing. Some airlines, including British Airways, have stopped flying there; others are greatly reducing their service. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within China, some medical experts have questioned their country’s response, arguing that local officials should have imposed stricter travel restrictions before the virus spilled out of Wuhan. The country has now confirmed cases in every province and region.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents have complained that local authorities kept mum about the outbreak’s severity — initially insisting that there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission outside Wuhan — but admitted the truth after press reports in Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the dimensions of the outbreak became clear, the mayor of Wuhan on Monday offered to resign.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A W.H.O. delegation was allowed to visit Wuhan for just one day. Dr. Gauden Galea, the organization’s representative in Beijing, said the visit was not intended “to pass judgment.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Everything is being done with a sense of intensity, and to our assessment, good practice,” he added. “I don’t want to be an apologist. You have to understand the large scale and the comprehensiveness of the operation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Following the trip, China agreed to permit international experts coordinated by the W.H.O. into the country to work with Chinese scientists on containing the epidemic. The C.D.C. is assembling a team to join them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The W.H.O. has made just five emergency declarations since its power to do so was established in 2005: for the pandemic influenza in 2009; a polio resurgence in 2014; the Ebola epidemic in West Africa that year; the Zika virus outbreak in 2016; and an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and one of the discoverers of the Ebola virus and the presence of AIDS in Africa, agreed with the W.H.O.’s emergency declaration but felt the process was flawed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is time for the W.H.O. to change its all-or-nothing, binary approach” to declaring an emergency, Dr. Piot said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“In every emergency, there is a spectrum of alert levels.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Tedros expressed the same frustration at a news conference on Wednesday, suggesting that the agency might need to switch to a graduated “green-yellow-red" system.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Chris Horton from Taipei.

In Singapore, tens of thousands of residents have signed a petition calling for the government to ban Chinese nationals from entering the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam, businesses have posted signs saying that mainland Chinese customers are not welcome. In France, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/GillesKLEIN/status/1222084973638885379/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">front-page headline</a> in a regional newspaper warned of a “Yellow Alert.” And in a suburb of Toronto, parents demanded that a school district keep children of a family that had recently returned from China out of classes for 17 days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The rapid spread of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus&amp;variant=show&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;context=Menu" title="">coronavirus</a> that has sickened about 9,800 people — the overwhelming majority in China, with all of the 213 deaths there — has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While officials scramble to contain the crisis — the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and the State Department issued a “do not travel” to China advisory — fears over the dangerous outbreak have fueled xenophobia. And the wave of spreading panic has, at times, far outstripped practical concerns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a time when China’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-world-power.html" title="">rise as a global economic and military power</a> has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West, the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Some of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China, which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the response to the outbreak can be seen as a rational calculation based on the risk of infection: Airlines are canceling flights to Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and other Chinese cities, and conference organizers are asking Chinese delegations not to attend. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Late Thursday, Italy’s prime minister said that his country had blocked all flights to and from China. And countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Vietnam have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated, or China altogether.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think it is time to put a temporary ‘do not enter’ sign on our doorstep for visitors from China,” said Ralph Recto, a lawmaker in the Philippines.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bangkok residents are avoiding malls that are particularly popular with Chinese tourists. A plastic surgery office in the wealthy Gangnam neighborhood of Seoul has instructed employees that they can see Chinese customers only if they can prove that they have been in South Korea for 14 days or more, the potential period that the virus can lie dormant.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a sushi restaurant in the neighborhood that once housed the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/asia/tokyo-fish-market-tsukiji.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Tsukiji fish market</a> in Tokyo, where about 90 percent of the customers are Chinese, Yaeko Suenaga, 70, a server, said she understood why some stores might want to reject visitors from China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t think this fear comes from discrimination,” Ms. Suenaga said, “but from the true fear that humans have of getting infected with a virus that may lead to death.” Ms. Suenaga said that her restaurant would continue to welcome all customers, but that workers would wear masks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is not always easy to discern the boundary between understandable fear and unmistakable discrimination. But some protective measures have effectively amounted to racial or ethnic profiling.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At Bread Box, a banh mi restaurant in central Hoi An, a popular tourist outpost in Vietnam, the owners posted a makeshift sign outside their storefront this month reading, “We can’t service for Chinese, SORRY!” Up the coast, the Danang Riverside Hotel announced on Saturday that it would not accept any Chinese guests because of the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kwong Wing Catering, a small restaurant chain in Hong Kong, announced in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/%E5%85%89%E6%A6%AE%E9%A3%B2%E9%A3%9F-Kwong-Wing-Catering-116149449769292/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Facebook post</a> on Wednesday that it would serve only patrons speaking English or Cantonese, the city’s native language — a tongue distinct from the Mandarin spoken on the mainland. The business has been a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-christmas-dinner/were-all-family-now-protesters-gather-for-free-christmas-dinner-in-hong-kong-idUSKBN1YU03L" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">vocal supporter of the Hong Kong democracy movement</a> that has risen up in defiance of Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Public health experts said they understood some of the impulses. “In a sense, it’s a natural reaction to try to distance yourself from a potential cause of illness, particularly when there’s no known cure,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://aparc.fsi.stanford.edu/people/karen_eggleston" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Karen Eggleston</a>, director of the Asia health policy program at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But examples in both mass and social media have clearly crossed a line. In Australia, The Herald Sun, a Murdoch-owned newspaper, published the words “China Virus Panda-monium” over an image of a red mask. More than 46,000 people from the resident Chinese community in Australia signed a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.change.org/p/herald-sun-strongly-require-the-apologies-from-herald-sun-and-daily-telegraph" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">petition</a> that called the headline “unacceptable race discrimination.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Le Courrier Picard, a regional newspaper in northern France, caused outrage with its “Yellow Alert” headline this month. The newspaper later <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.courrier-picard.fr/id64729/article/2020-01-26/propos-de-notre-une-du-26-janvier" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">apologized</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Twitter in Japan, where there has long been unease about the conduct of Chinese tourists, commenters have labeled them “dirty” and “insensitive” and have called them “bioterrorists.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Disinformation is also running high. A much-viewed YouTube video in South Korea claims that a biochemical weapons facility in China leaked the coronavirus, a theory that has gained currency in other corners of the globe. In Australia, a fake post circulating on Instagram warned that shops in Sydney containing items like fortune cookies, rice and “Chinese Red Bull” were contaminated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The episodes of racism have swept up other people of Asian descent. In France, one Vietnamese woman <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/01/29/coronavirus-le-racisme-antiasiatique-se-propage-en-france_6027701_3244.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told the newspaper Le Monde</a> that she had been insulted by a car driver who shouted “Keep your virus, dirty Chinese!” and “You are not welcome in France” as he sped away through a puddle, splashing her.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Australia, Andy Miao, 24, an ethnic Chinese Australian who returned this month from a trip to China, said that passengers on public transport gave him odd looks if he was not wearing a face mask.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It makes people like me who are very, very Australian feel like outsiders,” Mr. Miao said. “It’s definitely invoking a lot of past racial stereotypes.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese — and Asians in general — were subjected to similar xenophobic reactions during the SARS epidemic of 2003. But now far more Chinese are traveling abroad: According to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Chinese travelers made about 150 million overseas trips in 2018, up more than 14 percent from the previous year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s lockdown of tens of millions of people, intended to curb the spread of the virus, may be spurring other governments to overreact, said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The fact that the Chinese government itself is treating people like that would in some ways enable or encourage some of the other people or governments to take equally draconian measures,” Mr. Nakano said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some governments are trying to ease the panic. In Toronto, politicians, a school board and some community groups have issued public appeals to avoid a repetition of the racism that swept the city in 2003, when SARS killed 44 people there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“While the virus can be traced to a province in China, we have to be cautious that this not be seen as a Chinese virus,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.yrdsb.ca/schools/Repository/NewsEvents/Pages/BoardNews/Message-From-The-Director.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the school board in the York Region, a suburb with many Asian residents, said in a statement</a> issued on Monday. “At times such as this, we must come together as Canadians and avoid any hint of xenophobia, which in this case can victimize our East Asian Chinese community.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although Indonesia has suspended flights from Wuhan, the governor of West Sumatra, Irwan Prayitno, ignored a plea from a citizens group to reject all Chinese tourists. On Sunday, he went to the airport to welcome 174 Chinese visitors from the southwestern city of Kunming.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo, which is often thronged with Chinese tourists, Michiko Kubota, who runs a clothing boutique, said she hoped the Japanese government might do more to help China, such as by sending masks or other medical supplies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Japan and China may be critical of each other sometimes, but the kindness is mutual,” Ms. Kubota said. “I hope we could do more to help eradicate fear in China as well.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Reporting was contributed by Ian Austen, Hannah Beech, Aurelien Breeden, Jason Gutierrez, Makiko Inoue, Isabella Kwai, Su-Hyun Lee, Tiffany May, Seth Mydans, Katrina Northrop, Jin Wu, Eimi Yamamitsu and Li Yuan.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The man was accused of pulling and damaging the doctor’s mask and protective clothing — potentially exposing him to the virus — after his father-in-law died in the hospital. The man was later detained.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, hospitals in the region renewed pleas to the public for help to replenish their supplies, which were fast disappearing. The shortages have become especially severe in Huanggang, a city of seven million not far from Wuhan, where some medical staff members were wearing raincoats and garbage bags as shoe covers to protect against infection, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.yicai.com/news/100483434.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to Yicai</a>, a financial news site.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Amid growing unease, the World Health Organization <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html" title="">declared</a> a global health emergency,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>which acknowledges that the disease now represents a risk beyond China. Nations can then decide whether to shut their borders, cancel flights or screen people arriving at ports of entry. Late Thursday, the State Department urged Americans not to travel to China, issuing a Level 4 advisory, which represents the highest safety risk.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also Thursday, Chinese government agencies announced plans to issue subsidies of up to $43 per day to front-line medical workers and to reopen factories to boost production of medical supplies and protective gear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We absolutely cannot let Huanggang become a second Wuhan,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, said at a news briefing on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday evening, provincial leaders said at a news briefing that the director of Huanggang’s health committee had been fired.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many Chinese, such decisive government announcements are too little, too late. Concerns have grown as the death toll from the coronavirus has quickly ticked upward, rising by 43 to hit 213 on Friday. All but one of those recent deaths have occurred in Hubei Province; the other died in the southwestern province of Sichuan.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fueling the anger on Thursday was the publication this week of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?query=featured_coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a new paper about the coronavirus in The New England Journal of Medicine</a> by a team of researchers affiliated with, among other places, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hubei Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Drawing on data from the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the paper states that “there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese people online were incensed, asking why the government had waited until Jan. 20 to inform the public that the virus was capable of being transmitted from human to human. By Thursday evening, many had seized on the paper as evidence that the authors had purposely withheld valuable information out of academic self-interest.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m about to explode, I need an explanation from the authors!!!!” Wang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, wrote in a widely shared social media post that was quickly deleted. “As a researcher with firsthand information, you knew that the virus could be transmitted between humans three weeks before the public did. Did you do what you were supposed to do?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As China raced to contain the outbreak, countries grappled with how to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/asia/wuhan-china-coronavirus-evacuations.html" title="">evacuate their citizens from Wuhan</a> and how to stop the virus from spreading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Australia announced a plan to evacuate its citizens in Wuhan to Christmas Island, which has played an important but checkered role in the country’s contentious use of faraway sites to house refugees and other migrants. The announcement drew immediate questions over the implications of using the island as a quarantine site.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Moving people to Christmas Island is not an “appropriate solution,” Dr. Tony Bartone, the president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rFUZcKrz1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">television news interview</a>. He said the government had other, more suitable facilities, such as military sites.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Japan, a furor erupted over the refusal of some evacuees who had returned to submit to medical testing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two of the Japanese citizens who have been evacuated from Wuhan refused to be tested for the coronavirus, leading the prime minister to explain that citizens could not be forced to submit to a medical examination.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japanese social media users said the travelers, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, were putting the country at risk. Some called them terrorists.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We tried to persuade the two returnees from Wuhan for many hours” to be tested, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Parliament on Thursday, when asked about the government’s treatment of repatriated citizens. “But there is no legally binding force, and that’s a great regret.” Mr. Abe said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russia ordered 16 of its approximately 25 crossing points on its 2,600-mile border Chinese border to be closed as of midnight local time as fears about the coronavirus outbreak mounted in Moscow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have to do everything to protect our people,” Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday in televised<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://government.ru/news/38878/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> remarks</a> at a cabinet meeting.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Italy blocked thousands of people from leaving a cruise ship that docked there on Thursday over concerns that someone aboard might have the virus. Although a Chinese national with a fever later tested negative for the coronavirus and the Italian authorities said passengers were allowed to disembark, for much of the day the country was gripped by fears that the coronavirus had arrived on its shores. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That concern proved warranted later Thursday, when the government reported the country’s first two confirmed cases, neither of which were related to the ship.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced that Italy had halted all flights to and from China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has sickened more than 43,100 people in China and 24 other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the United States, health officials on Thursday reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus in the United States. The patient is the husband of a woman who was the first reported case in Chicago, officials said at a news briefing. The woman, who is in her 60s, had returned from Wuhan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The American commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said the United States could see a positive byproduct from China’s woes because the outbreak could prompt employers to move jobs to its shores.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Mr. Ross said in an interview on Fox Business. “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to the U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His remarks may be seen as insensitive to a country in crisis, and he has faced such criticism in the past. During the government shutdown in early 2019, Mr. Ross suggested that furloughed workers should take out loans while they went without pay for more than a month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the evacuations and lockdown, Wuhan, a typically bustling metropolis, has been transformed into a ghost town. Since the city was effectively sealed off last week, most shops have shut down. The city government has put restrictions on traffic. The lack of transportation options has made it difficult for medical workers and sick residents to get to hospitals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But most residents of Wuhan<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>are not leaving their homes because they are too scared of catching the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Local Wuhan residents who aren’t worried about being sick aren’t even going on the streets,” Chen Qiushi, a Beijing-based lawyer who has been in Wuhan since the lockdown began, said in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">video blog</a> posted on Thursday. “The locals are all very scared.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Wuhan residents step outside, it’s mostly to go to the supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies that stay open as part of a government effort to sustain the city. Senior officials have promised that residents need not worry about vegetables, fruit or other staples.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Wuhan residents have been able to buy food, some complained about price increases or expressed fear that a prolonged shutdown might choke off food supplies. And if the shutdown lasts weeks longer, with the rest of China also scrambling to secure food supplies, it could make things more serious, several residents said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes.

Davis Lin and Mike Benoist</h3>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s Thursday, January 30.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well, we started hearing reports in early January that there was this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in central China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a mystery virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">People were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which scientists were calling a coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead to pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals, things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this virus.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty small problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been infected and that, of those, only about four had died.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was treatable and that things would be O.K.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was happening.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations like this?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000 people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it comes to public health.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they needed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so what do you do?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks, enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"></p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Once I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him because he was challenging the official narrative about what was happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what was happening to his posts once they went online?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did he tell you?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions, that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">This is the moment when the world begins to wake up.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">That are doing surveillance.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It is. It’s growing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The number of people who have died —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll climbing once again overnight.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">26 deaths so far from the —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— has now passed 40.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yeah.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Are you anxious?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">I mean, understandably.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And then the very next day, I hear —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">What do you mean?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Why?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, thank you.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thanks, Michael.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"> That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro.

So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">This is the moment when the world begins to wake up.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">That are doing surveillance.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It is. It’s growing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The number of people who have died —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll climbing once again overnight.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">26 deaths so far from the —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">— has now passed 40.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Yeah.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Are you anxious?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">I mean, understandably.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And then the very next day, I hear —</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Wow.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">You would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">What do you mean?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Why?</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Exactly.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Javier, thank you.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Thanks, Michael.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">We’ll be right back.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd">Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today.</p>, <p class="css-8hvvyd"> That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro.

Senior officials have promised that residents need not worry about supplies of vegetables, fruit or other staples, even as large swaths of the province, Hubei, are also locked down to curtail the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet Wuhan residents complained about price hikes, and expressed fear that a prolonged shutdown might choke off food supplies. Poorer people, both in urban Wuhan and in the countryside, would suffer more acutely from tightening supplies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes.

Sincerely, Secular India.” That really spoke to me because 1947 was the partition, when Hindus in Pakistan decided to stay or flee to India, and Muslims in India had a similar choice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">India chose secularism in 1947. It was majority Hindu and said its strength was its diversity, and that it would embrace Christians and Muslims and Sikhs just as much as its Hindu citizens. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Why is one protest in particular — a highway sit-in by Muslim women in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh neighborhood — seen as so significant?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over all, India’s Muslim community has not been well organized in recent decades, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/world/asia/india-protests-modi-citizenship.html" title="">these protests have mobilized it</a>. Shaheen Bagh has become a symbol of that. And women’s place in Indian Muslim homes has tended to be a conservative stereotype: They don’t come onto the streets, they don’t protest, they don’t mobilize. So Shaheen Bagh has really changed the game.</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">That’s it for this briefing.

Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan at the end of December. Chinese authorities confirmed they had identified a new virus a week later.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW DANGEROUS IS IT?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus, identified by scientists as 2019-nCoV, is a coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is unclear how deadly the new virus is. Although severe cases can cause pneumonia and death, there may be many cases of milder disease going undetected. Many of those who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, although it is not clear how easily that happens. Most cases so far are in people who have been in Wuhan, family members of those infected, or medical workers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Transmission is most likely through close contact with an infected person via particles in the air from coughing or sneezing, or by someone touching an infected person or object with the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In order to reduce the likelihood of transmission, the WHO recommends that people frequently wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those who develop symptoms such as coughing and fever who have been in China in the last 14 days should call ahead to a healthcare professional to establish if they need to be tested.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHERE HAS IT SPREAD TO SO FAR?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All but around 70 of the more than 6,000 cases so far identified have been in China, mostly in and around Wuhan. The other countries with confirmed cases include Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, the UAE, the United States, and Vietnam.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The WHO is looking very closely at cases of person-to-person transmission outside of Wuhan, which would suggest that it may have the potential to spread further.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHAT ARE AUTHORITIES DOING?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has put Wuhan into virtual quarantine to try and stop the spread of the virus. A number of foreign governments have advised against non-essential travel to China and have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IS THIS LIKE SARS?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus is a strain of coronavirus, like SARS, which killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unlike SARS, which also originated in China, it is believed the new virus can spread during the incubation period of one to 14 days, possibly before an infected person is showing symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, the new virus does not appear to be as deadly as SARS, but there have been more cases overall.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Compiled by Alex Richardson and Rosalba O'Brien; Edited by Bill Berkrot)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Alphabet Inc's Google has said it is temporarily shutting down its offices in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The coronavirus will likely have the largest negative impact on goods and services sectors within and outside of China that rely on Chinese consumers and intermediary products," Moody's analysts said in a report on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The assessments suggest the impact could be larger than that of the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the last novel virus to cause global alarm.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That outbreak resulted in about 800 deaths and slowed Asia's economic growth. But the overall effect on the U.S. economy was ultimately limited and short-lived. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as the Moody's analysts and others point out, China accounts for a bigger share of global economic growth now than it did then, and the world is more closely connected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the past week, amid news of coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a dozen other countries, trading in U.S. Treasuries reflected rising concern about a spillover effect.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Futures tied to the Fed's target policy rate also moved in the past week, and are now pricing in bets the Fed will cut interest rates again in July.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">CAREFUL COMMENTS</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his news conference on Wednesday, Powell gave no hint the central bank plans to lower borrowing costs anytime soon. Indeed, he suggested the global risks from uncertain trade policy and slowing global growth, which prompted the Fed's three rate cuts in 2019, looked to be receding, prompting "cautious optimism" on the U.S. economic outlook this year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, his careful comments about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak likely reflects behind-the-scenes work by Fed staffers, who brief policymakers at each meeting on risks to the economic outlook. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed's May 2003 policy meeting, which occurred as the extent of the SARS epidemic was becoming apparent, began with a briefing on uncertainties, including the effect of the outbreak on various Asian economies and the potential knock-on impact for the U.S. economy, a transcript of the meeting shows.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Staff at the time modelled a worst-case "SARS demand shock" showing a 0.3 percentage point hit to U.S. GDP growth in the second half of 2003, with the impact lasting to the first half of 2004. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir in Washington; Editing by Paul Simao)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

It's a weird feeling. I feel like I'm in an apocalypse somehow," said Schneider in a phone interview with Reuters on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese officials cut most transport links to Wuhan on Jan. 23 in an effort to slow transmission of the virus, which has infected nearly 6,000 people in China - more cases than were recorded in the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak - and killed more than 130 people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Schneider, who holds dual U.S.-German citizenship, thought of dashing to a train out of the city that morning, but said his parents advised against it. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"They said that the train station was not the place to be at time like this with the virus," he said. "So I decided to stay ... and that's when I was scared for the first time because I didn't know what to do."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He contacted German and American officials seeking a way out. The U.S. embassy offered him a $1,100 seat on a charter flight, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But an embassy official told him he would have to get himself to the airport on the other side of Wuhan, 30 miles (48 km) away, he said. With most transportation down, he found no way to make the trip, and an embassy staff member told him that they would give his seat to someone else, Schneider said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I couldn't believe what I just heard. That's not how you deal with a citizen in need ... it seemed like she didn't care," Schneider said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That flight left Wuhan with 210 Americans aboard. It was due to arrive in California on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Priority was given to vulnerable individuals at higher risk from coronavirus: small children, older adults and persons with other health conditions that put them at greater risk," a State Department official said by email on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Schneider, who has lived most of his life in Germany, then turned to German embassy officials, who he said promised him a bus ride to the airport with several other stranded students and seat on a flight to Germany on Saturday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Representatives of the German government could not be reached for immediate comment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until then, Schneider said he will hunker down in his room, heading out only to go to a nearby market for fresh water and food.

Shares in Mondelez were up 2.6% after the bell.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mondezlez's chief executive, Dirk Van de Put, said the coronavirus is expected to have only a short-term impact. China accounts for nearly 4.5% of the company's sales.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It's really too early to quantify for us at this point," Van de Put said of the expected impact. "We are monitoring the situation closely." Mondelez will update the market as needed, he added. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We now have to see in the coming weeks what has happened with the sell-out during Chinese New Year," Van de Put said. The Chinese government has asked Mondelez to keep two factories closed for 10 days to minimize the risk of infection, he said. Wuhan, China, is the epicentre of the virus, which has killed more than 160 people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We also have voluntarily put some travel restrictions to our own people to travel less within China and also for our global people to travel less to China," Van de Put said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Van de Put also said Brexit is a risk to the company, but he does not expect to see an impact this year. "If there is no deal near the end of the year, that would possibly be a disruptor," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Emerging markets like China - where incomes and demand for e-commerce are rising - have become increasingly important to Mondelez as the consumer goods industry grapples with slowing demand in developed countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mondelez has been pushing hard on investments and can still be in more stores, Van de Put said. He singled out growth in the company's biscuit businesses in India and China, as well as strong chocolate and gum sales in each country, respectively.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Illinois-based company has invested heavily in both countries in recent years, spending more on marketing and creating products. In China, for instance, Mondelez has been working for years with Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall to expand its reach, creating novelties like wasabi- or hot chicken-flavoured Oreos. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company reported fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday that beat estimates, helped by a 4.5% rise in sales from the Asia, Middle East and Africa business.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $726 million (552 million pounds), or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Excluding items, Mondelez earned 61 cents per share, a cent above analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Net revenue rose 2.1% to $6.91 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $6.84 billion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Richa Naidu in Chicago and Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

But in the wake of a deadly viral outbreak, he's switched to a mask and medical gloves.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When you're dealing with life and death, it's a whole different ball game," he said in a telephone interview Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans, 27, was one of 195 Americans evacuated from the city of Wuhan and flown to March Air Reserve Base in Southern California until authorities confirm they don't have the coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed more than 170 people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most cases are in China, but the outbreak has spread to more than a dozen countries, and the World Health Organization declared a global emergency Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. on Thursday confirmed the country's first case of person-to-person spread of the virus, a man who is married to a Chicago woman in her 60s who got sick after she returned from a trip to Wuhan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans and the other evacuees, including children ranging from around a year old to about 13, are staying at the sprawling base where they received a battery of blood tests and were given nose, throat and mouth swabs, Evans said. Some test results won't be back for a week, he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the surroundings are fairly comfortable, Evans said Thursday that he and others are still being cautious about mingling.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m still wearing my mask and I’m still wearing my gloves," he said in a telephone interview. “We’re still not knowing who has it. I’m still taking major precautions. You don't know whether you're in the clear.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Today a lot of kids were enjoying the weather,” he said, and the base provided scooters, bikes, footballs and soccer balls for them to play with.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But at dinnertime, Evans added, “everyone’s getting their food and going right back to their rooms.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those being held at the base 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles arrived Wednesday morning. They aren't required to stay but had agreed to remain for at least 72 hours. Officials also can quarantine any of those evacuated on a case-by-case basis. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That happened to another American who tried to leave Wednesday night.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials in Riverside County ordered the person quarantined for two weeks unless medically cleared sooner, said Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesman for the county's public health agency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The order was issued “as a result of the unknown risk to the public" because the person had not undergone a complete health evaluation, the agency said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It can take up to 14 days for someone who is infected to develop symptoms, health officials believe. None of the Americans housed at base have shown symptoms of the virus since their arrival, Arballo said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans said he would remain until testing shows he is free of the virus. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He is a professional quarterback who moved to Wuhan several years ago to play in a Chinese football league. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The city of 11 million people felt joyful, he said, with residents getting ready for the Lunar New Year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then, in a matter of days, “it turned into chaos" as news broke of the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak. Suddenly, Evans said, people were swarming pharmacies and stores to get masks and disinfectant spray. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Friends translated the news for Evans, who speaks no Chinese.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I stocked up on rice, noodles, water, anything that could help me survive for a week or two,” Evans said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government shut down the city. Buses, trains, taxis, and personal cars were banned. The military patrolled some streets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That's when people, honestly, stayed locked in their homes,” Evans said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He compared the deserted city to an Old West ghost town.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I've never experienced anything like this before," he said. “Imagine new York city being shut down. I was completely scared at first, because I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen. I don’t speak the language, and my family is so far away.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans holed up in his home for a week and a half until he received the news that the U.S. Embassy was evacuating its diplomats and their families and other U.S. citizens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was notified that a chartered flight was carrying some of the 1,000 or so Americans in Wuhan back to the United States. The flight was coming in the next day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans said he was told, “If you can make it there, you're on the flight.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was a race against time," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans found an acquaintance who drove him to the airport. The embassy notified Chinese authorities of the license plate number so he could pass through the guarded streets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evans said he was No. 171 out of 195 people permitted on board. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the plane were two men in full hazardous material suits, who warned them about the seriousness of the outbreak. Nobody appeared sick but all of the passengers decided to wear masks throughout the flight, Evans said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The plane flew to Anchorage, where the passengers had health screenings, and then landed at March Reserve Air Base on Wednesday morning. The U.S. arrival was joyful, Evans said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were clapping, smiling, laughing ... there were cheers,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once he is cleared, Evans intends to visit his family. Then it's on to Switzerland, where is signed to play with the Bern Grizzlies this year. But he would like to return to Wuhan when the coronavirus outbreak recedes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The community is amazing, the people in Wuhan are amazing.

[<p>Advertisement</p>, <p>Supported by</p>, <p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70"></p>, <h1 class="css-1j5ig2m e1h9rw200" id="link-13656621" itemprop="headline"><span>How Well New China Virus Spreads Is Focus of Control Efforts</span></h1>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">The Associated Press</span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists are starting to fill in some key gaps in what's known about the new virus from China. New research suggests it spreads a little easier than regular flu but not as well as some other respiratory diseases like whooping cough or tuberculosis. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health officials are focusing on person-to-person spread as the virus extends its geographic reach. Nearly 8,000 cases have been confirmed in China, while a much smaller number of people have been reported in more than a dozen other countries. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE VIRUS?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. In 2002, one called SARS caused an outbreak of severe pneumonia in China and spread to other countries. It infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 until it was controlled by some of the same public health measures being used in the current outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2012, another coronavirus dubbed MERS began sickening people in Saudi Arabia. It still causes small numbers of infections each year. The World Health Organization has counted nearly 2,500 cases in the Middle East and beyond, and more than 850 deaths.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus is 75% to 80% identical to SARS, scientists have reported. So far, about 8,000 infections have been confirmed, nearly all in China. About 170 deaths have occurred. Its true mortality rate isn't known, because many infections may be going undetected in people who have mild or no symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW EASILY DOES IT SPREAD?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Based on the first 425 cases analyzed, each infected person spread the virus to 2.2 others on average, scientists reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. That's a bit more than ordinary flu but far less than some other respiratory diseases such as whooping cough and tuberculosis. The rate for SARS was estimated to be 3.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, officials reported the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread — the husband of a Chicago woman who had traveled to Wuhan, China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The rate of spread is a key factor in bringing outbreaks under control. It's the reason health officials are focused on finding and isolating new cases and checking on people in close contact with them. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It's not known whether anyone who is infected but not showing symptoms can spread the virus. But at a news conference earlier this week, the U.S. government's infectious diseases chief, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said outbreaks are not driven by that kind of spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WHERE DO THESE VIRUSES COME FROM?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected had visited or worked at a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In the New England Journal report on the first 425 confirmed cases, Chinese scientists said that 55% of those before Jan. 1 were tied to that market but only 8% of cases after that were.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS initially was traced to civet cats sold in a live animal market, but later scientists decided it probably originated in bats that infected the civets. People can catch MERS from infected camels, although again, bats likely first spread that coronavirus to camels.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists have said the new virus seems similar genetically to some bat viruses, but it's not known if that is the source in nature or if another animal may be involved. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW DOES IT SPREAD? WHO'S MOST AT RISK?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unlike SARS, the new virus "looks like it doesn’t transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact,” said Dr. David Heymann, who headed WHO’s global response to SARS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And while it's too soon to be sure, Heymann said the new virus appears most dangerous to older adults who have other health problems. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Few of the early cases occurred in children, and more than half were in adults 60 and older, the New England Journal report this week says. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">IT’S FLU SEASON IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE — HOW WILL PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since symptoms are similar — fever, cough and in more severe cases shortness of breath or pneumonia — it takes a medical test to tell. There is one, but health authorities in China, the U.S. and elsewhere are working to make it more widely available.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given that it is flu season in China, too, it's “all the more impressive that they were able to recognize this outbreak quickly,” Dr. Brian Garibaldi of Johns Hopkins University said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The average incubation period — from infection until symptoms show up — is about five days, the New England Journal study says. However, symptoms have turned up much later, supporting the wisdom of a two-week observation time, the authors wrote. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HUNTING VACCINES</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While there is no vaccine — or specific treatment — for SARS or MERS, Fauci said it is technically possible to create a vaccine against this new virus. NIH did develop a potential vaccine candidate for SARS. It proved safe in a small first-step study in people but never was tested further because by then, the outbreak was ending.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time around, scientists have more of a head start. Just weeks after the first unusual pneumonias were reported, Chinese scientists mapped the genes of the viral suspect and shared them with world health authorities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, NIH is among several groups working to create a vaccine for the new virus, using newer and faster technology than was available during SARS. Fauci hopes to begin first-step safety tests in about three months, but something ready for real-world use would take far longer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

For the year, the South Korean conglomerate posted operating profit of 27.8 trillion won, its lowest since 2015.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Samsung said it also expected January-March earnings to fall from the preceding quarter, reflecting low seasonal demand for chips and displays. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaking during a conference call, a Samsung chip executive flagged uncertainties in chip demand.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns are showing signs of easing recently, but we can't rule out the possibility that the situation would deteriorate," said Han Jin-man, senior vice president at Samsung's semiconductor business unit. He didn't identify specific issues that could affect the company. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">VIRUS OUTBREAK </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In contrast with Samsung's modest forecast, chip peers like Intel Corp and TSMC earlier offered positive outlooks, fuelling hopes of a rebound in chip prices after a slide that started in late 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Samsung offered a conservative outlook for the memory market, and there is a disconnect between market views and the company views when it comes to strength of the recovery," said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment &amp; Securities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meanwhile, after posting strong results, Apple earlier this week flagged uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China which economists fear could hurt the global economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday Samsung Electronics, which has chip, display and home appliance plants in China, declined to comment on the impact of the outbreak on demand. In a statement to Reuters, it said it had extended a holiday closure for some factories in line with Chinese government guidance. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But supplier Samsung SDI, which makes phone batteries and materials for chips and displays, said it expects current-quarter earnings to be adversely affected by the virus outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fourth-quarter operating profit more than halved to 3.45 trillion won in Samsung's mainstay chip division, while its mobile division profit surged by two-thirds to 2.52 trillion won, thanks to strong sales of flagship models and a revamp of its mid- and lower-end A series line-up. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Samsung said the actual pace of 5G network expansion and its effects on memory demand remains to be seen, although the company sees demand picking up around mass-market 5G models. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It said it aims to expand its presence in the 5G network equipment market in the United States, while continuing to look at the possibility of entering the European market.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This week Britain granted Huawei a limited role in developing the country's 5G mobile network, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West's next-generation communications.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

The Senate impeachment trial </strong>of President Trump is marching toward a swift end.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The second and final day of cross-examination is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-30?" title="">in its final hours</a>. In one of the tenser moments, Chief Justice John Roberts <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/politics/impeachment-trial-trump.html" title="">blocked a question</a> from Senator Rand Paul that would have revealed the identity of the whistle-blower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And Representative Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, above, jumped on a question about the Trump team’s broad interpretation of executive power.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What we have seen over the last couple days is a descent into constitutional madness,” Mr. Schiff said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Senators are expected to vote on Friday about whether to hear new witnesses, and Republicans appeared confident they would have enough support to block any new testimony and ultimately acquit Mr. Trump. But Democrats are hinting at a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-30#schumer-hints-at-a-tactic-to-delay-votes-to-acquit-trump" title="">gambit to frustrate the Republicans’ plans</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2. The U.S. issued a “do not travel”</strong> to China advisory, its strongest warning reserved for the most dangerous situations, over the coronavirus outbreak. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?" title="">Here’s the latest</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The warning came hours after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus spreading from China <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html" title="">a global health emergency</a>. Many countries have already taken emergency measures. Above, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Nearly 10,000 cases have been reported worldwide, including the first U.S. case of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?a" title="">person-to-person virus transmission</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Elsewhere, Russia partly closed its Chinese border and thousands were trapped on a cruise ship in Italy as fears spread about the coronavirus. And from Asia to Australia, Canada and France, the panic has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-chinese-racism.html" title="">unleashed anti-Chinese sentiment</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">3. It’s finally happening: </strong>Britain will leave the European Union on Friday night.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bloc’s 27 remaining member nations <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/europe/eu-brexit-decision.html" title="">signed off on Britain’s departure</a>, officially ending nearly four years of impassioned wrangling over whether, when and how it would happen. In typically low-key, bureaucratic style, it was completed by email.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this is Brexit, so there’s more. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/brexit-scotland-trade-eu.html" title="">London and Brussels have to try to hash out a trade deal</a> by the end of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">4. While the impeachment trial continued on Capitol Hill, </strong>it was business as usual at the White House.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration continued to weaken a century-old law protecting migratory birds by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/climate/trump-bird-deaths.html" title="">dropping the threat of punishment</a> for companies that kill birds “incidentally” in the course of operations. Above, oil-slicked birds in 2015.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The administration also said it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/medicaid-block-grant-trump.html?" title="">let states cap some Medicaid spending</a>, a long-held conservative goal aimed at curbing federal contributions. The change will most likely diminish the number of people covered. A legal challenge is almost certain.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Separately,</strong> preliminary data released by the Commerce Department showed that U.S. economic growth was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/business/economy/gdp-numbers.html?" title="">steady and in line with expectations</a> last quarter. But overall growth in 2019 was weaker than the previous year, hurt by trade tensions and Boeing’s troubles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">5. Joe Biden is gambling big on Iowa.</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His campaign has redirected funds from other early primary states to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/politics/joe-biden-fundraising.html" title="">buy nearly $9 million in ads in Iowa</a> ahead of Monday’s caucuses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there are three other Democratic candidates bunched into the top tier there: Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren. Mr. Biden’s fund-raisers, allies and campaign officials say that a disappointing finish could dampen his online fund-raising at a crucial juncture.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unsure which candidate best reflects your views and priorities? <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/30/us/politics/democratic-presidential-candidates-quiz.html?" title="">Take this quiz to see which could be your match</a>. The answer might surprise you.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">6. Life expectancy, </strong>the most basic measure of the health of a society, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/us-life-expectancy.html" title="">rose slightly in 2018</a> in the U.S., after a rare and troubling decline driven by the opioid epidemic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That dip, from 2015 to 2017, worried demographers, who had not seen an outright decline since 1993, during the AIDS epidemic. They now caution that it’s too early to tell if the country has turned the corner with opioid overdoses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Improvements in cancer mortality rates represented the single largest share of the life expectancy gain in 2018, at about 30 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">7. There may be no more familiar image</strong> of Los Angeles than the helicopters that buzz constantly overhead. And Kobe Bryant was one of the area’s most frequent fliers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Back in his playing days, Bryant was known to use helicopters to shuttle between his home in Orange County and the Lakers’ arena downtown to maximize time at home rather than on the freeway. His death on Sunday underscores the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/kobe-bryant-crash-helicopters-los-angeles.html" title="">ubiquity of the helicopter in this sprawling and traffic-choked metropolis</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000006946632/kobe-bryant-helicopter.html?" title="">Our video journalists retraced the flight path</a> of Bryant’s last helicopter ride to examine the conditions that may have lead to the crash.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">8. How can one</strong> be a decent person in a fallen world? It’s a question “The Good Place” and “BoJack Horseman” have tried to answer — in very different ways.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As both shows end this week, our critic reflects on how TV’s two great moral comedies — one about the perils of Hollywood and the other about the afterlife —<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/arts/television/the-good-place-bojack-horseman.html" title=""> showed us that doing the right thing is a group effort</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The creator of NBC’s “The Good Place” (the finale is tonight at 8:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, and 7:30 Central), talked to us about political parallels, silly tortures and what the show had to say about<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/arts/television/the-good-place-michael-schur.html" title=""> “the impossibility of being alive.”</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">9. The Super Bowl halftime show demands a pop unicorn. </strong>This year, that unicorn is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/arts/music/jennifer-lopez-super-bowl.html" title="">Jennifer Lopez</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than 20 years into a music career that doesn’t always get enough credit, and a recent Oscar snub for her work in “Hustlers,” she seems to have finally found validation in her pop career. Taking center stage on Sunday night, alongside Shakira, is a role she was born to play, our writer argues.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Looking back, perhaps the most bizarre halftime show in Super Bowl history happened 25 years ago. It had snakes, it had Indiana Jones, it had Patti LaBelle dressed as a temple goddess. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/sports/football/super-bowl-halftime-1995.html" title="">It was a circus</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">10. And finally,</strong> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/dining/drinks/best-wines-under-20-dollars-winter.html" title="">20 reds under $20</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As of October, the Trump administration put a 25 percent tax on all wines under 14 percent alcohol from France, Spain and Germany.

Royal Dutch Shell fell 4.8% before clawing back some losses after fourth-quarter profit halved to its lowest in more than three years.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">U.S. companies continue to produce earnings that are stronger than European results, leading Wall Street to be better positioned to weather any economic impact, Meckler said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note &lt;US10YT=RR&gt; fell two basis points to 1.57% and slipped to 1.55% overnight, the lowest since Oct. 10.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The closely watched yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted for the second time this week, a bearish signal for the economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">German government bond yields fell sharply, with 10-year German bund yields dropping to a three-month low. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dollar fell on news the U.S. economy posted its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 and personal consumption weakened dramatically, ending the currency's rally on safe-haven demand from investors nervous about the fallout from the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dollar index had gained 0.65% in the last two weeks as investors sold off risk assets on coronavirus fears.

Options include a partial or full sale, he said without giving a timeframe.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company said the review was triggered by the sales slowdown of traditional black tea in developed markets as consumers shift towards herbal tea. Black tea is the dominant part of Unilever's tea business, Pitkethly said, selling in 60 countries and generating 3 billion euros (£2.5 billion) in annual sales. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unilever has been suffering elsewhere, too, with stuttering growth in India and China, two of its biggest emerging markets, while intense competition in North America and Europe has also hampered efforts to hit full-year growth targets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The decision to launch a strategic review of its tea business reflects an attempt under CEO Alan Jope to reposition the company towards areas of higher potential after a period in which growth has been harder to come by," said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SHIFTING TASTES</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The food and refreshment business - which makes Lipton teas and Hellmann's mayonnaise among other products and contributes 40% to group sales - has been hit particularly hard in North America and Europe as consumers reach for healthier options. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We are pleased to see some progress on the disposals strategy," Liberum analyst Anubhav Malhotra said of the review, while Jefferies analysts said it could kickstart further moves to unlock value in the food and refreshment division.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Six months after taking the helm in January last year Jope announced his attention to target sustainability even at the cost of losing some revenue. The CEO said he would streamline Unilever's vast portfolio by focusing on what he described as "brands with purpose", adding that these were its fastest-growing assets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The so-called brands with purpose, including Dove, Knorr and Persil, contributed almost two thirds of revenue and drove 75% of sales growth in the first half of 2019, the company said. Brands thought to be among those that didn't have purpose were Marmite, Magnum Ice Cream and Pot Noodle.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There have been no disposals as yet, though rivals Nestle and ABInBev have each sold food operations worth billions of dollars over the past year to refocus on their core businesses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The maker of products as diverse as Dove soap and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream reported fourth-quarter underlying sales up by a slightly better than expected 1.5%, though this was still the slowest quarterly growth since at least 2009.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">GROWTH FOCUS</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"There is no clarity around the two key issues: how will sales growth rise back to the top end of the 3-5% target range, and is this something management are focusing on, or are their 2020 margin targets more of a focus," said Freddie Lait, founder of Unilever shareholder Latitude Investment Management.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jope's focus, however, is on growth, he said on Thursday after the results from his first full year in charge showed annual turnover grew 2% while underlying sales gained 2.9%.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"If it does come to a trade-off between margin and growth, we will certainly prioritise growth," he told analysts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On its long-term outlook the company said it would step up execution and improve brand awareness and availability while seeking to accelerate innovation in on-trend areas such as plant-based foods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares in Unilever were up 1.5% at 45.06 pounds by 1252 GMT, the second-biggest gainer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The stock is up 11% over the past year, slightly outperforming the FTSE 100, which has been roiled in recent weeks by growing concerns over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak in China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unilever said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak was too early to quantify but it could affect a fifth of its China professional food service business because fewer people will eat out. China contributes 5% to Unilever's total sales. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Anglo-Dutch company said it expects a stronger second half in 2020, helping it to achieve full-year underlying sales growth in the lower half of a 3-5% range. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">($1 = 0.9014 euros)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

One difference was the characterization of household spending, it went from strong to moderate. We want to follow that closely because the consumer really is the engine driving the U.S. economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The much bigger takeaway from this is the continuing repo operations through at least April of 2020. That is really helping to expand the Fed’s balance sheet. While it is not their intention it is creating something akin to the environment we saw during QE. By extending it at least to April, they come one step closer to having a standing repo facility, which I don’t think is a bad thing. But we have to recognise that it could create a bit of euphoria in the markets.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">MICHAEL PURVES, FOUNDER AND CEO, TALLBACKEN CAPITAL ADVISORS, NEW YORK</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We're dealing with a very static Fed. The statement was pretty similar to the December statement."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"This is what the markets and certainly I (were) expecting, to be reinforcement of a no-hike, no-cut policy.

We're still going to see balance sheet expansion from until April, which is what we expected.

I think their biggest fear is that they can’t do that before the next recession.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">RICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY:</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"It couldn't be more consistent with what they've said before, and of course they're on hold here. You've got a lot of countervailing economic issues for them to face and the possible impact of the virus slowing some global demand... But, on the other hand, demand remains robust with consumers... There's nothing that indicates inflation is about to take off." </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">ELLEN HAZEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IN WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS: </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The key reaction is going to be in the Q&amp;A at the press conference when they talk about what they are going to do with the balance sheet. It is an open question whether or not the change in the Fed’s balance sheet has directly driven the increase in the S&amp;P 500 since last fall. Certainly, if you overlay those two charts on one another they look very similar.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The key question is how much the different Fed members care about managing the S&amp;P 500 because there are certainly those people out there who will say that if you start to shrink the balance sheet you will cause the market to decline and particularly whether the administration believes that. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"One warning sign, or one negative sign, out of this statement is the change about household spending that it has declined from strong to moderate. I was a little surprised to see that, frankly, so it will be interesting to see what data they have been looking at to draw that conclusion.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">JOSEPH SROKA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT NOVAPOINT IN ATLANTA: </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"I didn’t notice anything different. There was no expectation that rates were going to change, especially going back to the December minutes which indicated that the Fed had no intention of changing monetary policy unless there was a significant change in the trajectory of the U.S. economy." </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">CANDICE BANGSUND, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBAL ASSET ALLOCATION, FIERA CAPITAL, MONTREAL.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There were no surprises in the statement. We continue to believe that the Federal Reserve will remain comfortably on the sidelines through 2020. The global headwinds that were primarily responsible for the Fed’s dovish pivot in 2019 have now largely subsided, with trade tensions de-escalating and recent developments in the UK reducing the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are some hopeful signs that the factory-driven slump in global growth may finally be finding a floor, though coronavirus fears could temporarily derail this narrative in the near-term. Policymakers have emphasized that they will tolerate higher, above-target inflation in order to compensate for years of missing the mark. Taken together, this suggests that the threshold for a move in either direction remains high at this time.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">PETER NG, SENIOR FX TRADER AT SILICON VALLEY BANK, SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Expectations were low going into the FOMC. There weren't many changes, but there was one notable downgrade on the consumer sector in the wording. Household spending rising at a 'strong pace' to a 'moderate pace'. That was notable."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"They did raise the interest on excess reserves by 5 basis points. The markets appeared divided on that, but they did come through. It seems like concerns over tightness in short term money markets have subsided for the time being."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"They will continue to extend repo operations through the tax period of April, which is a good thing, I believe."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">CHRIS GAFFNEY, PRESIDENT OF WORLD MARKETS, TIAA BANK, ST. LOUIS</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Fed’s going to remain on hold for the foreseeable future, as long as GDP growth and inflation doesn’t move outside of the bands that we’re stuck in, anchored right around 2%. The Fed is not going to get in the way of the markets. They will continue to fuel the equity market rally with lower interest rates, and as we get further into the year, it’s going to become harder and harder for them to make any interest rate moves because then it will be seen as political.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For markets today, it should be positive. The Fed continues to support the markets with lower interest rates.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">KATHY JONES, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is about as neutral a statement as you could write.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It might surprise a few people that they’re only talking about extending the repo operations through April. It makes sense because they have to get through tax day. But maybe that was a subtle hint that – don’t expect this to last forever. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It will be interesting to see if there’s any insight in terms of how (the coronavirus) is affecting their thinking. I’m guessing we’re not going to know too much because they don’t know too much about it yet, so what could they really say with any conviction.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES IN NEW YORK: </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The one thing I was surprised by was that there was no specific mention of the coronavirus which could be a problem for the global economy. And there was no dissent. The vote was unanimous. That implies that the Fed is going to stay on hold here. Of course they always leave the door open."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">    </span>"Early in the day when the market was strong we turned around on the news that the number of virus victims in China had jumped.

It has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S., including the first U.S. case of person-to-person transmission reported Thursday by health officials. The State Department on Thursday advised all U.S. citizens against traveling to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump, a self-described germaphobe, generally has discussed the virus in broad terms, but he offered some of his most extensive comments on the issue to date during an appearance Thursday at a Michigan manufacturing plant. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Hopefully, it won't be as bad as some people think it could be, but we're working very closely with them (Chinese) and with a lot of other people and a lot of other countries," he said. “We think we have it very well under control.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump described the handful of U.S. cases as a “very little problem” and said those people were “recuperating successfully.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But we're working very closely with China and other countries and we think it's going to have a very good ending for us. That I can assure you,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump also has discussed the situation with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted photos from a White House Situation Room briefing on the virus, writing that “we have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In keeping with the low-profile approach, the White House announced by email Wednesday night that the meeting included members of a task force that will lead the U.S. response. The 12-person team is chaired by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and coordinated through the National Security Council.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a “dope” and “incompetent" and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigor. He nudged Congress to make a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to help with the international response. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he’s taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted “fanning the flames” as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis. That leaves room, Gostin said, for public health professionals to take the lead.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"As long as that continues and as long as there isn’t political interference or mass quarantines in the U.S. or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it,” Gostin said. He added that he'd like to see Trump ask Congress for a $1 billion emergency appropriation to help agencies battling to contain the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump is well aware the virus outbreak in China could create a wild card for the U.S. economy during an election year. And he has long prioritized the U.S. economic relationship with China, especially during trade negotiations, and similarly largely held his tongue during widespread protests in Hong Kong. He also takes enormous pride in the personal relationship he's developed with Xi and has commended him for demonstrating “transparency" as he deals with the crisis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked about the virus while traveling abroad last week, Trump said “we have it totally under control.” In a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus," Trump tweeted. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But some public health experts say Trump's rosy assessments of the situation don't match the ground truth. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gostin pointed to Chinese government bureaucratic delays that led to tens of thousands of people traveling outside of Wuhan province, increasing the likelihood that the virus will travel far beyond China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s not accurate at all,” Gostin said of Trump’s assessment of China’s handling of the outbreak. “China manifestly does not have this under control."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump's budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there's strong bipartisan support for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indeed, the money government disease detectives are tapping to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional idea.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Associated Press writers Josh Boak, Lauran Neergaard and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Growth last year was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2.9% notched in 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow shrugged off the 2019 performance, telling Fox Business Network "it is a fundamentally healthy economy," and expressed confidence that activity will accelerate this year, a view not widely shared outside the administration.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Thursday's snapshot of gross domestic product showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter, that was in part because of a smaller import bill, which has since swelled as the year ended. Consumer spending cooled considerably last quarter and scope for a rebound looks limited as wage growth appears to have stalled.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the longest expansion in history, now in its 11th year, probably remains on track and a recession is unlikely as the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in 2019 kick in. The Fed kept rates unchanged on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters the U.S. central bank expected "moderate economic growth to continue" but also nodded to some risks, including the recent coronavirus outbreak in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration's 18-month-long trade war with China last year fueled fears of a recession. Though the economic outlook has improved with this month's signing of a Phase 1 deal with Beijing, economists do not see a boost to the economy as U.S. tariffs remained in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching the third-quarter pace, also as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of houses. Growth was also supported by increased government spending on defense. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation. Last quarter's rise in GDP growth was in line with economist's expectations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1.8%.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at a 1.4% rate in the fourth quarter, the slowest in four years. This measure of domestic demand rose at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The economy had very few engines left at year end to keep flying high in 2020," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. "The economy is in a good place only because the trade war made imports so expensive that American businesses and consumers cut back their purchases."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists have long disagreed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual GDP growth to 3.0% on an sustainable basis, because of low productivity and population growth. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They also argue that historically there has not been a very strong relationship between corporate tax rates and business investment. Some companies including Apple used their tax windfall for share buybacks. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street fell as the coronavirus epidemic heightened concerns about China's economy. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BUSINESS INVESTMENT SLUMPING</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Business investment fell at a 1.5% rate in the fourth quarter. It was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009. There were decreases last quarter in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, and industrial equipment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Spending on nonresidential structures contracted in 2019 by the most since 2016. Trade tensions have eroded business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With confidence among chief executive officers remaining low in the fourth quarter after dropping to a 10-year low in the prior quarter, a rebound is unlikely soon. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Business investment is also seen pressured by Boeing's suspension this month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes. Boeing on Wednesday reported its first annual loss since 1997.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.8% pace after rising at a brisk 3.2% rate in the third quarter. There was a reduction in spending at restaurants and bars.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week, the tight labor market is not generating a faster pace of wage growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the fourth quarter, personal income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation rose at a 1.5% rate, stepping down from a 2.9% pace in the third quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The decrease in imports in the fourth quarter, in part because of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, compressed the trade deficit. That led to trade adding 1.48 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth, the most since 2009. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"When trade adds more to growth than consumption, you know things are out of whack," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last quarter's decline in imports resulted in businesses almost depleting inventories in warehouses. A 40-day strike at General Motors also weighed on motor vehicle inventories. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Inventories rose at a $6.5 billion rate in the fourth quarter, the smallest gain since the second quarter of 2018, after increasing at a $69.4 billion pace in the July-September quarter. Inventory investment chopped 1.09 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter, the most since 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

But as slavery had recently become unconstitutional, he argued that the next best thing was to keep Chinese people out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His speech and his subsequent advocacy served as major drivers of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-Exclusion-Act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, the nation’s first law banning immigration by a specific group based solely on race or nationality.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Boalt didn’t attend the Berkeley law school, nor did he teach there. His advocacy for Chinese exclusion was, according to Mr. Reichmann, his most significant legacy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The law school was named for him out of respect for his wife, Elizabeth Josselyn Boalt, who had contributed to the university after he died in 1901.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Mr. Chemerinsky became the dean of the law school in July 2017, he appointed a small committee to research the issue.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The committee found that the naming of the building wasn’t a condition of Ms. Boalt’s gift; if it had been, he said, “it would be a very different situation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The committee’s report was distributed to the school community for feedback. Unsurprisingly, people had thoughts.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’d estimate I got about 800 comments,” he said, about two-thirds of whom favored the change. “I was struck by the almost unanimity of our students, faculty and alumni of color.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In November 2018, Mr. Chemerinsky said he formally accepted the recommendation to stop using the Boalt name.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the process wasn’t over: The campus had started its own <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/building-name-review-committee/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Building Name Review Committee</a>, which did a shorter review and solicited more campus feedback.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, the change was approved by U.C.

Later on Thursday, a Chinese man in his 50s, who had previously stayed in Wuhan, was found be infected in the western prefecture of Mie, Kyodo news agency reported, bringing the total number of cases in Japan to 12 including the three evacuees. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The two people who were confirmed as infected but had not shown symptoms were the first such cases in Japan, though suspicion has been rising elsewhere that people who have the virus but no symptoms can infect others.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That would make the virus much more difficult to control.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Japan on Tuesday classified the virus a "designated infectious disease", which would allow compulsory hospitalization and the use of public funds for treatment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the designation - which takes effect on Feb. 7 after ordinances are issued - does not apply to people without symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked about concern over transmission of the virus from people who have not shown symptoms, a health ministry official said it was not clear whether that had happened.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shigeru Omi, head of the Japan Community Health Care Organization, told a briefing that there were reports of such transmissions in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said this week the virus was infectious during incubation, which can range from one to 14 days. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A second charter flight carrying 210 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo on Thursday.

There have been previous cases in China and elsewhere of the virus spreading between people in a household or workplace. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other five U.S. cases are travelers who developed the respiratory illness after returning to the U.S. from China. The latest patient had not been in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chicago woman came back from the central China city of Wuhan on Jan. 13, then last week went to a hospital with symptoms and was diagnosed with the viral illness. She and her husband, both in their 60s, are hospitalized. Neither have been identified.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man began feeling sick Tuesday and was put in isolation that day. Tests confirming that he was infected came back Wednesday night, Illinois health officials said at a Chicago press conference. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twenty-one people, including health care workers, who may have had close contact with the man are being monitored, the officials said. But they were quick to try to ease any concerns that the case may signal the start of local outbreak. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The risk to the general public remains low. This person-to-person spread was between two very close contacts, a husband and wife,” said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man generally relies on his car to get around, had not been on any public trains in the Chicago area and had not attended any large gatherings, officials said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts have said they expected additional U.S. cases, and that at least some limited spread of the disease in the country was likely. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We anticipated this,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. “The kind of contact that you have in a household is very close and very prolonged. That’s the kind of circumstance where we would anticipate a virus such as this could be transmitted."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The quick detection and isolation of the new patient shows, "The system is working,” said Schaffner, adding that he does not expect the virus to become widespread in the country.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus is a member of the coronavirus family that's a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. The new virus has sickened thousands, mostly in China, and killed about 170.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Older people, and those with other health conditions, are believed to be at greater risk for severe illness from the virus. The new patient has a health condition, but health officials did not say what it is.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An international outbreak caused by the virus first emerged last month in China. Doctors there began seeing the new virus in people who got sick after spending time at a wholesale food market in Wuhan. Officials said the virus probably initially spread from animals to people, as did SARS and MERS.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other U.S. cases are in Arizona, Southern California and Washington state, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">AP reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Some to U.S., probably some to Mexico as well,’’ Ross told Fox Business Network. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus, from the coronavirus family, has paralyzed business in China. The industrial hub of Wuhan and other Chinese cities are on lockdown. China has reported more than 7,700 cases and 170 deaths.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The crisis has also begun to ripple through U.S. companies with operations in China. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. More than half of Starbucks’ stores in China are now closed. McDonald’s has closed several hundred restaurants in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ross emphasized that he didn’t “want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease.’’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, though, that “the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain.’’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even before the viral outbreak, many U.S. and other foreign companies had been rethinking their presence in China and considering their options for relocating elsewhere, possibly elsewhere in Asia. That is partly because President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports in a war over Beijing’s economic policies and partly because Chinese labor and other costs have been rising.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But skeptics doubt that many American companies with deep roots in China might abandon the country purely over the virus. For one thing, no one knows how long the viral outbreak will last or how much damage it may inflict. And it takes significant time for companies to choose suppliers or locations for their factories.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rosemary Coates, whose Blue Silk Consulting firm helps companies make such decisions, said it was “ridiculous’’ to think the viral outbreak would result in a significant return of business to the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can’t snap your fingers,’’ she said. “It can take 18 months or two years to find another supplier. It isn’t easy. It’s complicated.’’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wuhan, a center of China’s steel industry, has attracted General Motors and many other foreign manufacturing giants.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “You can’t just say General Motors is going to pick up and move away,’’ Coates said. “They have a manufacturing plant there and expertise there. Their supply chain runs through there.’’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In fact, U.S. direct investment in China, which includes factories, continued to rise even after the SARS outbreak disrupted the Chinese economy in 2003. And labor costs will continue to remain far higher in the United States than in China and other Asian countries such as Vietnam.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Companies that are leaving China are not coming to the U.S.,’’ said Coates, who is also executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit that researches issues surrounding corporate decisions on whether to return to the United States. “They’re going to other Asian countries ....

Fears over the spread of the flu-like virus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, are increasing as the death toll topped 160.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus appears to represent the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the SARS outbreak, which at its peak in April 2003 led to a 45% plunge in passenger demand in Asia, analysts said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The White House is considering further restrictions on U.S. airlines flying to and from China in addition to voluntary restrictions the companies have put into place, President Donald Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The matter is under discussion every day," he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">British Airways said it suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BA.com, the airline's website, shows no direct flights to mainland China available to book in January or February.

The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centred Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon's cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number," Hood told Reuters. "The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft said revenue for its "commercial cloud" - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"This quarter was an absolute 'blow out quarter' across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft's headquarters location in Redmond, Washington.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centres that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited "hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft's revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centres and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft's shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s Google.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers," said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Its Productivity and Business Process unit, which contains the LinkedIn social network, reported $11.8 billion in revenue compared with estimates of $11.4 billion. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Revenue in the unit that contains Windows was $13.2 billion, compared with estimates of $12.8 billion. Over the past year, Windows sales were hampered by shortages of PC chips from Intel Corp, but the chipmaker said last week it had alleviated most of those supply concerns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion (8.2 billion pounds) and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Ayanti Bera in Bengaluru; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Leslie Adler)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

"Karl-Johan is not going anywhere, in reality he has just got a change of mandate, and Helena has been around for some time," she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Karl-Johan will in May move into the role vacated by his father, 72-year-old Stefan Persson - the chairman for more than 20 years - marking a shift to a younger generation at the top of the company.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">RECOVERY ON TRACK</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares surged as much as 10% after the world's no. 2 fashion retailer also beat earnings expectations for the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">H&amp;M is recovering from years of sliding profits and mounting inventories due to slowing footfall at its core H&amp;M-branded stores.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Profit in the September through November quarter was 5.40 billion crowns ($569 million), up from 4.35 billion a year before. Analysts had on average forecast a profit of 4.78 billion crowns, according to Refinitiv data.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Big investments in logistics, digital technology, new store concepts and independent brands to meet changing shopping habits and tougher competition helped push annual net sales 11% higher in Swedish crowns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The ongoing transformation work has contributed to continued positive sales development, with more full-price sales, lower markdowns and increased market share," the company said in a statement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outgoing chairman Stefan Persson, who was CEO from 1982 to 1997, said in a rare interview that it was a good time to step down now that the company was in good condition. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The industry is struggling with huge problems, and I would say that we have now managed to transform, even though there are still many challenges ahead, in a way that has left us with our financial position more or less intact and able to weather also future challenges," he told Reuters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">H&amp;M said in its earnings report its financial position was strong. Its net debt to profit before depreciation and amortisation ratio, which it has a target of keeping below 1.0, improved to 0.2 in the quarter. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">NO REVOLUTION</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stefan said he expected little change to strategy under the new regime. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"Helena has been with the company for a long time, and in such positions that there will not be any revolution as such.

But in future we won't be able to use the natural resources that we depend on today, not in the same way," Helmersson told Reuters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak of the newly identified coronavirus in China had a negative impact on sales in that country at the end of January, outgoing CEO Persson said at a press conference to accompany the results in Stockholm on Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; Additional reporting by Colm Fulton, Johannes Hellstron and Johan Ahlander; Writing by Anna Ringstrom and Sonya Dowsett; Editing by Niklas Pollard and Jan Harvey)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

For all of last year, economic growth — 2.3% — was the weakest since Trump's election in 2016.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The picture that emerged Thursday from the government's first estimate of growth in the October-December quarter was a mixed one: Consumers kept spending, but they have grown more cautious. Incomes are rising but at a slower pace. Most alarmingly, businesses have been sharply reducing their investment as Trump's ongoing trade fights have heightened uncertainty for corporations. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, low interest rates, low inflation and a robust job market have given consumers and home buyers the means to keep fueling steady, if only modest, growth. Global risks — including potentially severe economic damage from China's viral outbreak — will continue to overhang the economy. But they're also likely to persuade the Fed to keep interest rates low and perhaps even further reduce them if the threats to the economy escalate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many economists saw Trump's decision to lower trade tensions by signing a Phase One agreement with China as key to lowering the risk of a recession this year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">'"The economic fundamentals are very solid right now," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. “Some of the downside risks that the Federal Reserve had been concerned about have faded now that we have a Phase One trade deal.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lawrence Kudlow, head of the president's National Economic Council, said Thursday he expects GDP growth will be helped in the coming year by the new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, and the commitments by the Chinese to boost purchases of U.S. exports.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“China has to work its way through this health crisis, but I think once that abates, you will see big export" gains, Kudlow told reporters at the White House.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the October-December quarter, growth was supported by solid but slower consumer spending and an improvement in the trade deficit. Those factors offset a further drop in business investment in new plants and equipment and a slowdown in businesses' restocking of store shelves.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The full-year 2.3% growth of GDP in 2019 marked a sharp drop from the 2.9% gain in 2018, when the economy enjoyed a boost from Trump’s tax cuts and from billions in increased government spending.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most economists foresee even slower growth in 2020 of around 1.8%. That assumes no serious damage from the coronavirus or other threats.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even the U.S. elections for the White House and Congress could end up weakening growth if the campaigns were to further elevate uncertainty among consumers and businesses and thereby lead them to cut back on spending.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Trump, GDP growth has so far fallen well short of his campaign pledges. But unemployment has reached a 50-year low during his presidency. And after trade tensions with China began to cool late last year, the stock market rebounded and attained new highs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the presidential election may turn on how the economy is faring in key swing states.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What really matters is the economy in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,” Zandi said. '"There things are not going well because the trade war has done a lot of damage in those states."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the fourth quarter, consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of economic activity, slowed to an annual gain of 1.8%. That was down from an annual spending surge of 4.6% in the second quarter and 3.2% in the third quarter. The slowdown was led by a drop-off in new car sales.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Business investment spending fell for a third straight quarter, dropping at an annual rate of 1.5%, a decline that has been blamed on business uncertainty generated by the rising trade tensions. The hope is that business will start investing again now that the Trump administration has declared a trade ceasefire with China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trade contributed to growth in the fourth quarter with imports, which subtract from U.S. growth, falling much faster than exports. That trend added 1.5 percentage points to growth in the quarter. But economists see this trend as only temporary: Many U.S. businesses had accelerated their pace of imports in the July-September quarter to get ahead of an expected increase in Trump's import taxes.

In addition, all train traffic between Russia and China was halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A passenger airliner enlisted for the evacuation took off Thursday morning from a former Portuguese military airport southeast of Lisbon carrying only the pilots and crew. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Capt. Antonios Efthymiou said the flight would stop in Paris to pick up a team of doctors and extra crew members before heading to Hanoi and then China. Efthymiou told Portuguese media it would bring back about 350 Europeans. He said the crew would take special medical precautions but did not elaborate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Britain said its delayed repatriation flight for 200 U.K. citizens in Wuhan would leave ther Friday, with the returning Britons quarantined for 14 days upon arrival. The U.K.-government chartered plane had been due to return earlier but it was delayed because permissions form the Chinese government had not come through.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China so far has reported nearly 200 deaths and about 8,000 confirmed cases of the virus on its mainland. Outside China, there are more than 80 infected people in 19 countries. Those include 13 confirmed cases in Europe so far: five in France, five in Germany, two in Italy and one in Finland.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A scare over a 54-year-old woman with flu-like symptoms led Italian authorities to keep 6,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members on the cruise ship docked north of Rome. The Costa Crociere cruise line said the woman and her partner, who had no symptoms, were put into isolation Wednesday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The passengers were allowed to disembark on Thursday after tests for the new virus from China came back negative, Italian coast guard Capt. Stefano Varone said. The ship was sailing from Mallorca, Spain, to Civitavecchia on a weeklong Mediterranean cruise. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While those tests came back negative, two Chinese tourists visiting Rome tested positive for the virus, Premier Giuseppe Conte said Thursday, adding that Italy had barred flights coming from and going to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Germany confirmed a fifth case there, all involving employees at Munich-based auto parts maker Webasto, which has facilities in Wuhan. Officials think the virus was transmitted by a Chinese employee who visited Germany for training earlier this month and tested positive on her return to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Czech Republic announced it was stopping issuing visas to Chinese citizens due to the outbreak. More than 600,000 Chinese tourists are estimated to have visited the Czech Republic last year, especially its old-world capital city of Prague.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the retail front, Swedish furniture and home goods retailer IKEA announced all its stores in mainland China would remain closed to protect customers and staff from the outbreak. The stores are a favorite haunt of Chinese city dwellers, both for shopping and for just hanging out. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More European airlines announced halts in service to China, all citing efforts “to protect the health and security of customers and staff.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Air France suspended all its regular passenger flights to and from China until Feb. 9. The French carrier had already suspended flights to Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak, and reduced traffic to Beijing and Shanghai. Air France said it will run special flights starting Thursday to bring back some customers and employees from Beijing and Shanghai.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scandinavian Airlines announced it was halting all its flights to Beijing and Shanghai beginning Friday and running through Feb. 9th. SAS has 12 regular weekly flights from Scandinavia to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Spain’s Iberia national airline halted the three return flights a week it runs between Madrid and Shanghai due to the virus, a move it said would continue through February.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finnish national airline Finnair said it has stopped accepting new bookings on its flights to mainland China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those announcements followed earlier moves to halt or reduce flights to China by other European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Swiss and KLM, which after the weekend is adding Beijing and Shanghai to its list of suspended Chinese destinations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus comes from the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">European passengers escaping Wuhan by air are expected to reach France on Friday. Then they will be quarantined for 14 days, but as compensation they will be put up at a southern vacation resort with a view of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In contrast, American evacuees from China are being kept at a military facility.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The French resort is in the small town of Carry-le-Rouet. Its mayor protested the move, fearing it could keep people away from a local sea urchin culinary festival this weekend, town hall communications director Peggy Molina said. But the French government simply requisitioned the resort, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Underlining EU nations' hasty preparations to respond to the virus, Molina said the town hall was told only Thursday that it would be hosting evacuees starting Friday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">—-</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Associated Press writers Nicole Winfield in Rome, Ciaran Giles in Madrid, Karel Janicek in Prague, Gianfranco Stara in Civitavecchia, Angela Charlton and Elaine Ganley in Paris and Daria Litvinova in Moscow contributed to this report.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries," he said. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China," he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the wake of numerous airlines cancelling flights to China and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald's temporarily closing hundreds of shops, Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“During my discussion with the president and other officials, they're willing to support countries with weaker health systems with whatever is possible,” Tedros said. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, France confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China raised the death toll to 170 on Thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China's worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus in Japan and Germany is worrying. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Japan, a man in his 60s caught the virus after working as a bus driver for two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, a man in his 30s was sickened after a Chinese colleague from Shanghai, whose parents had recently visited from Wuhan, came to his office for a business meeting. Four other workers later became infected. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Koopmans said more information was needed about how the virus was spread in these instances and whether it meant the virus was more infectious than previously thought or if there was something unusual in those circumstances. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mark Harris, a professor of virology at Leeds University, said it appears that the spread of the virus among people is probably easier than initially presumed. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If transmission between humans was difficult, then the numbers would have plateaued,” he said. Harris said the limited amount of virus spread beyond China suggested the outbreak could still be contained, but that if people are spreading the disease before they show symptoms — as some Chinese politicians and researchers have suggested — that could compromise control efforts. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party Communist state's determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain's Wellcome Trust, welcomed WHO's emergency declaration. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,” he said in a statement. “It is also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cheng reported from London.

Here are the central parts of the plan, why it’s so controversial and how people on different sides of the issue are responding. </p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-666175c1">‘The borders of Israel will be redrawn’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Background: </strong>The state of Israel was forged after the Holocaust in the crucible of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, which left Israel with control over 78 percent of what had previously been British-controlled Palestine. After the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel took control of the remaining 22 percent of Palestinian land, as well as the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria. </p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Today, there are nine million Israeli citizens, about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-election-arabs/israels-arab-minority-urged-to-boycott-election-over-divisive-law-idUSKCN1RH0KQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">1.9 million of whom are Arab</a>.</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">In the occupied territory of the West Bank, where Palestinians are subject to Israeli military law, there are about three million Arabs, most of whom live under the semiautonomous Palestinian Authority.</p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Roughly two million Arabs also live in Gaza blockaded by Israel under the rule of Hamas, which the United States and other countries have deemed a terrorist organization.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some proposals for a two-state solution have looked to the pre-1967 borders as a palimpsest over which the lines of a new Palestinian state might be sketched.

Today, those refugees and their descendants, spread out across the region, number around five million. </p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Many Palestinians believe they have the right to return to their ancestral properties, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.un.org/unispal/data-collection/general-assembly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in keeping with the United Nations</a> Resolution 194. </p>, <p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">The plan explicitly rejects this idea.

For the better part of a century, he says, Western powers have repeatedly tried “accommodating the Zionist demand for a Jewish-majority state in a land populated overwhelmingly by Palestinians.” This, he contends, is a circle that cannot be squared. Instead, “Israelis and Palestinians should work together to craft a constitution that would uphold the rights of all.”</p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-15035b19">‘Jerusalem will remain the sovereign capital of the State of Israel’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Mr. Trump’s plan, Israel would gain formal sovereignty over an undivided Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinian capital would sit on the outer edge of the city beyond an existing wall. The city’s status as a holy site for all three Abrahamic religions has made it a central point of contention in peace negotiations. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Under the United Nations’s 1947 partition plan, Jerusalem was never intended to be the capital of any country, </strong><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mcall.com/opinion/mc-trump-israel-sanctions-buttu-yv-1209-20171208-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ms. Buttu wrote in 2017</a>, but “rather a shared city under an international regime with sovereignty resting with neither Israel nor Palestinians.” In 1980, the United Nations deemed Israel’s declaration of Jerusalem as its unified capital <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/478" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a violation of international law. </a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">But Mr. Trump’s plan stipulates that returning to a divided Jerusalem “would be a grave mistake,”</strong> particularly because it would entail “having two separate security forces in one of the most sensitive areas on earth.” And many Israeli Jews, such as the writer Shmuel Rosner, believe that Jerusalem <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/opinion/jerusalem-capital-israel-trump.html" title="">“is our capital and it always will be.”</a></p>, <h2 class="css-1320w4z eoo0vm40" id="link-67c2b4d8">‘A demilitarized State of Palestine’</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump’s plan sets aside the goal of a full-fledged Palestinian state; he promised that Palestinians could “achieve an independent state of their very own” but gave few details.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Mr. Netanyahu said the deal provided a “pathway to a Palestinian state” under as-yet-unspecified conditions. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">This future entity, however, would lack certain characteristics of a state</strong>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-fact-check-trump-did-not-actually-offer-the-palestinians-a-state-1.8466670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">explains the Israeli reporter Amir Tibon</a>. “The streets of all of its cities, towns and villages, as well as the roads connecting them, will be under the full control of the military of another state — Israel.

It Depends</span></h1>, <p class="css-1fv7b6t e1jsehar1" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">By<!-- --> <span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name">The Associated Press</span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SEATTLE — People around the world are buying up protective face masks in hopes of keeping the new virus from China at bay. Some companies have required them for employees. Schools in South Korea have told parents to equip their children with masks and hand sanitizer when they return from winter vacation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But do the masks work? It depends.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All viruses are small enough to get through a typical strap-on medical mask, but the germs don't generally spread through the air one at a time, said Dr. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Denison studies SARS and MERS, which are coronaviruses, the same family as the new virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead, viruses ride from person to person on droplets from a sneeze or cough. Those droplets land on hands and other surfaces, where they are touched by others, who then touch their own eyes, noses or mouths.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masks can block large droplets from a sneeze or cough. That means they have some value, Denison said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also, someone in a mask can't touch their own nose and mouth. That can prevent the wearer from picking up germs left on surfaces by someone who is sick, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masks are “a very sensible precaution" while scientists work to study exactly how the new virus is transmitted, said University of Oxford researcher Trudie Lang.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">None of this, however, is based on rigorous research. Nobody has compared groups of masked and unmasked people by exposing them to the new germ, Denison said. A 2017 review of studies in health care workers suggested masks offer some protection against SARS, but the authors noted “existing evidence is sparse and findings are inconsistent.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The best way to avoid getting sick from the new virus is to wash your hands with soap and water. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. That's the same advice for avoiding regular cold and flu viruses.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not currently recommend masks for the general public. Health officials announced Thursday a sixth U.S. case, the husband of a woman who got sick after returning from Wuhan, China, and the first instance of the virus spreading person-to-person in the United States. Health officials said the risk to the general public in the U.S. remains low.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The CDC does recommend masks for people being evaluated for the new virus, people confirmed to have it, household members and caregivers. Airline crew should offer a face mask to a sick traveler, the CDC said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Health care workers treating patients with the new virus are advised by the CDC to take additional precautions such as goggles or face shields.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">UNICEF said Wednesday it has shipped six metric tons of respiratory masks and protective suits to China for use by health workers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Tokyo, 21-year-old hotel employee Hasumi Tsuchida said she wears a mask. “I work in a hotel where many guests are from China," she said. “I worry a bit when foreign guests arrive.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Masks have been commonly used in some countries when wearers are sick, fighting allergies or on days when air pollution is bad. The new virus has fueled demand for them around the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Respilon, a Czech company that makes its “nanofiber” masks in China, sold 700,000 of them last year worldwide. Since last week, it received orders for 7 million more. The problem: It cannot make any because the Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holiday in a bid to contain the virus’ spread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Taiwan, where the holiday is over, factories are up and running. Premier Su Tseng-chang said the government had already distributed 23 million masks and that Taiwan will be able to produce 4 million more a day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A mask factory in Shanghai has gone into overdrive despite the holiday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are now working 24 hours, two shifts a day, 12 hours shift,” said Liao Huolin, president of the mask company. “We violated labor law,” Liao said, “but the workers understand.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">AP journalists Tong-hyung Kim in Seoul; Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo; Havovi Todd in London; Taijing Wu in Taipei, Taiwan; Erika Kinetz in Shanghai and Karel Janicek in the Czech Republic contributed to this report.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">___</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Although he does not have the coronavirus, Mr. Miao, who is of Chinese heritage and grew up in Australia, knows it’s because of one reason: his ethnicity.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It makes people like me who are very, very Australian feel like outsiders,” said Mr. Miao, 24, who returned from a trip to China earlier this month and has since seen jokes degrading Chinese people. “It’s definitely invoking a lot of past racial stereotypes.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as the World Health Organization <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html" title="">declared a global health emergency</a> after the virus spread to countries including Australia, he is worried about an outbreak of misinformation, panic and xenophobia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus has killed more than 200 people, with nearly 10,000 cases reported, though in Australia there are just a handful of cases, and health officials have said that the risk of catching it for many Australians is low.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, universities have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australian-universities-defer-exams-increase-response-to-coronavirus-outbreak" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">delayed exams</a>, face masks — used only weeks ago against bush-fire smoke — are a common sight, and the government plans to evacuate Australians from the epicenter of the outbreak in China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other responses here in Australia, where the relationship with China is contentious, have taken a more xenophobic bent. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some far-right lawmakers polled their followers, asking if Australians should ban Chinese people temporarily from the country. A newspaper in Victoria, The Herald Sun, called the coronavirus a “Chinese Virus” on its front page, prompting over 40,000 people to sign a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.change.org/p/herald-sun-strongly-require-the-apologies-from-herald-sun-and-daily-telegraph" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">petition</a> demanding an apology. On social media, fake announcements are warning people away from Chinese-populated areas, and memes are making light of early reports that the virus jumped from wild animals to humans.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Racism feeds on fear and anxiety,” said Tim Soutphommasane, a former race-discrimination commissioner and now a professor at the University of Sydney. While the virus originated in China, “viral diseases don’t have ethnic, racial or national characteristics,” he said, adding that the misinformation was “alarming.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, the government said that it planned to evacuate Australians citizens from the province to Christmas Island, an Australian territory 2,000 miles away from the mainland, to be quarantined for 14 days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But many questioned the implications of using Christmas Island, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/the-impossible-refugee-boat-lift-to-christmas-island.html" title="">where refugees and asylum seekers have been held</a>, instead of military bases on the mainland. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was not an “appropriate” place to quarantine people, Dr. Tony Bartone, president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rFUZcKrz1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">television news interview</a>. Faced with the decision, many Australians are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/australian-man-in-wuhan-says-he-would-rather-stay-than-go-to-christmas-island" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">opting to stay behind in lockdown.</a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the rhetoric has been reminiscent of a time when Chinese people were purposely excluded from the country. “You could read a similar article in the goldfields in 1860s Victoria,” said Jon Piccini, a lecturer in history at the Australian Catholic University.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As scientists race to develop a vaccine, the virus is likely to continue to spread. Many wonder if it will further perpetuate stereotypes — the same ones that once prompted Australia to ban nonwhites from calling the country home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Miao said he did not blame people for being ignorant, though he added, “I don’t think it’s very fair.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Have you noticed or been affected by the fear around the coronavirus?

While they have become often out of order and otherwise neglected in recent years, dispensers for hand sanitizer are still found in most public buildings at their entrances and dotted along their hallways.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fear that pervaded the Toronto area during SARS resurfaced this week, if to a lesser extent, as the Wuhan coronavirus continued its rapid spread in China and around the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Traveling alongside that fear is xenophobia and discrimination against people of Chinese origin or people who simply appear to be from China. The public school board in York Region, north of Toronto, issued a statement effectively rebuking more than 9,000 people who signed a petition demanding that the children in a family recently returned from China be kept from their classes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read: </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-chinese-racism.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">As Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Anti-Chinese Sentiment</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As I write this, four cases of coronavirus have been reported in Canada and the anti-Chinese sentiment appears limited. The health care system is working smoothly, and officials have been open about what they’re doing and what’s going on. That’s a marked contrast to SARS, where chaos and mistakes, all cloaked in secrecy, dominated.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The extent of the turmoil in 2003 had dimmed in my memory until I recently read the report from an inquiry Ontario did after the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our public health and emergency infrastructures were in a sorry state of decay, starved for resources by governments of all three political parties,” Justice Archie Campbell wrote in his <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/e_records/sars/report/v1-pdf/Volume1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">final report released in 2006</a>. “The only thing that saved us from a worse disaster was the courage and sacrifice and personal initiative of those who stepped up — the nurses, the doctors, the paramedics and all the others — sometimes at great personal risk, to get us through a crisis that never should have happened.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Looking back, two things stand out about Toronto’s SARS outbreak. First, hospitals became the place where most people contracted SARS, 72 percent of them. And of the those patients, 45 percent were health care workers who became infected on the job.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then, after officials believed the crisis had turned the corner — to the point where Health Canada ran advertisements to that effect — they were forced to acknowledge under questioning at a news conference that a second lethal round of infections was underway.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS was even less understood than the coronavirus, which is nevertheless surrounded by many unknowns. There was not, among other things, any diagnostic test available for SARS during the outbreak.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The commission has not heard of any country or any health system that foresaw SARS,” the 2006 inquiry found. “SARS taught us that we must be ready for the unseen.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the report repeatedly notes, Canada had an example of the right way to handle outbreaks during SARS. Vancouver’s infection control systems, its well-developed systems for protecting health care workers and its clearly defined hospital protocols for dealing with outbreaks, made it possible for the city to successfully contain its five cases, only one of which involved a health care worker.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The coronavirus, so far, isn’t as virulent as SARS, and the number of admissions related to it here remains relatively low.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When I compare this to what I experienced as an emergency physician during SARS, this is a different situation and a better situation,” Dr. Daniel Kollek, a professor of emergency medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton told me. “I think we are more ready.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The changes over the last 17 years include better training, better systems for identifying infected patients and more hospital rooms with air filtering equipment. Additionally, clear and consistent updates and instructions from health authorities are now being given promptly to doctors, nurses and hospital administrators.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Canada does still lag, Dr. Kollek said, in planning for handling large-scale emergencies. Among other things, he said, in an era when many hospitals are regularly running at or beyond capacity, there is still no way to discharge patients who are not as seriously ill to free up beds during a crisis. He also said that large-scale health crises could be better handled by initially assessing patients outside of hospitals.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Times journalists from around the world, including me, are following the coronavirus situation as it develops.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the results of that is a regularly updated map of infections worldwide and a constantly revised briefing.

	As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across China, a flurry of early research is drawing a clearer picture of how the pathogen behaves and the key factors that will determine whether it can be contained.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	While the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. To avoid any viral illness, experts advise <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-tips.html">washing your hands</a> frequently and avoiding your office or school when you’re sick. Most healthy people don’t need masks, and hoarding them may contribute to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/coronavirus-masks-hoarding.html">shortages</a> for health workers who do need them, experts say.
</p>, <h2 class="g-subhed g-optimize-type " id="transmission">
<span class="g-balancer" data-id="1">How contagious is the virus?</span>
</h2>, <p class="g-body g-summary ">
	It seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	The scale of an outbreak depends on how quickly and easily a virus is transmitted from person to person. While research has just begun, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316">scientists</a> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/">have</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3524675">estimated</a> that each person with the new coronavirus could infect somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	That would make the virus roughly as contagious as SARS, another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 and was contained after it sickened 8,098 people and killed 774. Respiratory viruses like these can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	These droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. That makes the virus harder to get than pathogens like measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, which can travel a hundred feet through the air. But it is easier to catch than H.I.V. or hepatitis, which spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

	If each person infected with the new coronavirus infects two to three others, that may be enough to sustain and accelerate an outbreak, if nothing is done to reduce it.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Here’s how that works. In the animation below, a group of five infected people could spread the virus to about 368 people over just five cycles of infection.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Compare that with a less contagious virus, like the seasonal flu. People with the flu tend to infect 1.3 other individuals, on average. The difference may seem small, but the result is a striking contrast: Only about 45 people might be infected in the same scenario.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	But the transmission numbers of any disease aren’t set in stone. They can be reduced by effective public health measures, such as isolating sick people and tracking individuals they’ve had contact with. When global health authorities methodically tracked and isolated people infected with SARS in 2003, they were able to bring the average number each sick person infected down to 0.4, enough to stop the outbreak.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Health authorities around the world are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html">expending enormous effort</a> trying to repeat that.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	So far, the number of cases outside China has been small. But in recent days, cases have turned up in several countries, including the United States, with people who have not visited China. And the number of cases within China far surpassed the rate of new SARS cases in 2003:

	It’s hard to know yet. But the fatality rate is probably less than 3 percent, much less than SARS.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	This is one of the most important factors in how damaging the outbreak will be, and one of the least understood.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	It’s tough to assess the lethality of a new virus. The worst cases are usually detected first, which can skew our understanding of how likely patients are to die. About a third of the first <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext">41 patients reported in Wuhan</a> had to be treated in an I.C.U., many with symptoms of fever, severe cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. But people with mild cases may never visit a doctor. So there may be more cases than we know, and the death rate may be lower than we initially thought.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	At the same time, deaths from the virus may be underreported. The Chinese cities at the center of the outbreak face a shortage of testing kits and hospital beds, and many sick people have not been able to see a doctor.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	“There’s still a lot of uncertainty about what this virus is like and what it is doing,” said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who was at the frontlines of the Canadian response to SARS.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Early indications suggest the fatality rate for this virus is considerably less than another coronavirus, MERS, which kills about 35 percent of people who become infected, and SARS, which kills about 10 percent. All of the diseases appear to latch on to proteins on the surface of lung cells, but MERS and SARS seem to be more destructive to lung tissue.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Among 17,000 people who were infected in China, 82 percent had mild infections, 15 percent had severe symptoms and 3 percent were classified as critical, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the World Health Organization, on Feb. 7. Less than 2 percent of the people with confirmed infections had died. Many of those who died were older men with underlying health problems, Dr. Van Kerkhove said.

	Pathogens can still be very dangerous even if their fatality rate is low, Dr. McGeer said. For instance, even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.

</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	The time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected can be vital for prevention and control. Known as the incubation period, this time can allow health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus. But if the incubation period is too long or too short, these measures may be difficult to implement.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Some illnesses, like influenza, have a short incubation period of two or three days. People may be shedding infectious virus particles before they exhibit flu symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus. SARS, however, had an incubation period of about five days. In addition, it took four or five days after symptoms started before sick people could transmit the virus. That gave officials time to stop the virus and effectively contain the outbreak, Dr. McGeer said.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the new coronavirus has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. But it is still not clear whether a person can spread the virus before symptoms develop, or whether the severity of the illness affects how easily a patient can spread the virus.

	A coronavirus vaccine could prevent infections and stop the spread of the disease. But vaccines take time.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) By the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline even further. Researchers have already studied<a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2020/01/13/novel-coronavirus/"> </a><a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2020/01/13/novel-coronavirus/">the genome of the new coronavirus</a> and found the proteins that are crucial for infection. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, in Australia and at least three companies are working on vaccine candidates.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	“If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
</p>, <p class="g-body ">
	Dr. Fauci cautioned that it could still take months, and even years, after initial trials to conduct extensive testing that can prove a vaccine is safe and effective. In the best case, a vaccine may become available to the public <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html">a year from now</a>.

It also requested that all nonessential United States government personnel hold off on traveling to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In China, at least 213 people had died from the virus as of early Friday, the authorities said. The total number of cases worldwide was approaching 10,000, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of cases were in China.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know?

An Illinois man had contracted the virus from his wife, who had recently visited Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. Both were hospitalized.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also on Thursday, the union for 15,000 American Airlines pilots filed a lawsuit in Dallas County Court in Texas seeking a temporary restraining order to suspend flights to China. The union, the Allied Pilots Association, said that British Airways, Air Canada and Lufthansa had already suspended service to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We estimate that as many as 300 passengers and crew travel to DFW alone from Chinese cities on each American Airlines flight,” Eric Ferguson, the union’s president and a captain for American, said in a statement, referring to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the airline’s largest hub. “To us, that level of risk is unacceptable.’’</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The union said it had directed American Airlines pilots to decline flight assignments to China unless they were part of a return trip. It said that airline regulations required pilots to remain on the ground in China for about 32 hours so that they could get adequate rest.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The State Department has previously issued Level 4 advisories warning Americans not to travel to at least 12 other countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Iran, where the department cited the risk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of United States citizens.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other countries placed under a Level 4 travel advisory include Mali, because of crime, terrorism, and kidnapping; Venezuela, because of crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of Americans; and Burkina Faso, because of terrorism, crime and kidnapping.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Michael Levenson contributed reporting.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

This year, business owners like Qiu Xiangjian would be grateful if the god merely helped them get by.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Qiu, a 50-year-old farmer in Jiangsu Province, woke up that day to some troubling news. To battle the coronavirus outbreak spreading across China, the provincial government had ordered businesses except those necessary for daily life, such as utilities, pharmacies and supermarkets, to close until Feb. 10.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He can’t sell his chickens to slaughterhouses or meat markets. He had only two days of feed left for his 40,000 chickens, but all the feed factories had been shut down. If he can’t stock up on feed, he will watch his chickens starve.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For me, it’s not a matter of losing some money,” he said. “It’s a matter of losing everything.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s giant and tireless business machine came to a sudden halt last week. Many parts of the country started official and voluntary lockdowns to combat the pneumonialike outbreak, which has killed over 200 people and infected thousands. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html" title="">Big companies like Apple, General Motors, Ikea and Starbucks</a> are closing operations, changing the way they do business or preparing for financial hits.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They won’t be the businesses hit the hardest. Those would be China’s entrepreneurs — the farmers, shopkeepers, noodle stand owners and millions of others who delivered China out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and turned it into an economic powerhouse.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many were already struggling with China’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/business/economy/china-economy-reserve-requirement-ratio.html" title="">slowing economic growth</a> and increased <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/business/china-economy-private-enterprise.html" title="">government meddling</a>. The virus outbreak exacerbated the situation — or, as people in China say, added frost on top of snow.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My goal for 2020 isn’t growth but survival,” said Zhang Huan, an investor and entrepreneur in Guangzhou, a port city just northwest of Hong Kong. “We’re all one or two months away from bankruptcy.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their problems could be felt around the world. China’s small and medium-size businesses are an important part of its growth engine. Vice Premier <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.gov.cn/guowuyuan/2018-08/20/content_5315204.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Liu He</a>, the country’s economic czar, has repeatedly said they contribute more than half of China’s tax revenues, 60 percent of its economic output and nearly three-quarters of its technological innovation.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government has tried to ease their anxiety. Officials on Sunday ordered banks to go easy on people hit by the crisis who are struggling to repay their mortgage and credit card debt. It also encouraged more loans and lower interest rates for businesses that have been severely affected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The guidance was vague, however, and it doesn’t begin to address the breadth of problems.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those problems go beyond officials forcing businesses to close. Routes from one part of the country to another have been frozen. Some cities require companies to pay employees for their idle time. Those efforts could help keep people content, but they still represent a cost for business.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wang Chenyun, an internet entrepreneur, complained in his personal blog that the Shanghai municipal government not only extended mandated holidays to Feb. 9 but also required businesses to pay double wages to employees working from home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Shanghai government pays too much attention to big enterprises,” he wrote. “It doesn’t care whether small businesses can survive.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their plight speaks to China’s lack of checks and balances. The government’s firm control of the levers of power lets it mobilize resources to build huge infrastructure projects and combat an epidemic. It can also empower officials to go too far. Without an independent court system or a free news media, businesses have few ways to protest a policy or ask for help.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaking out would be difficult even in better circumstances. Broadly, businesses from hotels, restaurants and department stores to farmers like Mr. Qiu believe Chinese officials are justified in moving forcefully to stop the spread. (The government has also been criticized for its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan.html" title="">slow response</a> and for punishing those who tried to sound <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/virus-corona.html" title="">early warnings</a>, so it feels tremendous pressure from the public to act.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the government’s top-down, command-and-control approach doesn’t take into account the transformations within the country’s vibrant and dynamic economy, and may make it slow to respond to signs of distress from entrepreneurs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New highways and rail lines have made even the most rural parts of China dependent on other places. Mr. Qiu, for example, has problems beyond closed slaughterhouses and supply sources. Even if he could find supplies in other provinces, roads are closed for all nonlocal vehicles. The roads to his village have been blocked with piles of dirt.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If this continues, it will affect the chicken, eggs and the other meat supplies nationally in a few months,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/24/world/a-chinese-robin-hood-runs-afoul-of-beijing.html" title="">Sun Dawu</a>, a prominent businessman in Hebei Province who owns a company that supplies chicken farmers, wrote on Weibo, a social media site. “It can lead to market panic and affect social stability. I urged the government to take measures immediately.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China depends more on consumption and personal services than it did during the 2003 outbreak of SARS, another dangerous disease, which had a significant but short-lived impact on China’s growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of the country’s restaurants have closed for the time being. Haidilao, one of China’s biggest restaurant chains, shut down all of its 550 branches in the mainland. Beijing Dadong Roast Duck, a high-end chain, shut all of its 20-plus restaurants but two in Beijing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If things can’t resume to normal in two months, we’ll probably have to shut down our business,” Dadong’s owner, Dong Zhenxiang, said in an interview. He hopes the government can lower taxes, lower rent and provide some subsidies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Travel is another hard-hit industry, since the Lunar New Year holiday, which began last Saturday, is usually the busiest travel season of the year. Mr. Sun, the businessman in Hebei, said he had to close a hot spring resort and send all 1,500 workers on holiday. He estimated that he could lose over $7 million from that business alone.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Xu Zhihua, chief executive of sportswear brand Peak, wrote on his Weibo account: “The whole society has come to a standstill with almost zero consumption.” He worries that a lot of small and medium-size companies won’t be able to pay back their loans. “Then the whole economy will be finished!” he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More broadly, the coronavirus crisis emerged when many small and medium-size businesses were already struggling. China’s growth has eased to its slowest pace in nearly three decades. The trade war with the United States has rippled through parts of the country. Many people complain that the state-run banking system won’t lend them money at a reasonable rate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chinese government is also crowding them out. Big state-run companies are taking an increasingly important role in the economy, in a reversal of the trend of opening up to private enterprise that helped drive China’s success. The government interferes more online and increasingly demands that businesses pay greater heed to directives from the Communist Party.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the coronavirus has spread, Beijing officials have taken a heavier hand to control prices. For example, the government in Baoding, in the central province of Hebei, fined a shopping mall company nearly $300,000 for selling cabbages and cauliflowers at higher prices. Of course, China is hardly alone in punishing price gouging, and it won public praise for fining some pharmacies for raising prices of face masks, which are in short supply all over China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If cabbages were easily available, the store wouldn’t be able to charge higher prices — nobody would buy it,” said Liu Xuanhua, an economist. “If the outbreak continues, our ignorance about the market economy could end with us having nowhere to buy vegetables.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some industries, like chicken farmers, are trying to get the government’s attention. Farmers have created a sort of social media campaign to petition the government to open special transportation channels for their supplies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even the agricultural bureau in Huangmei County in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, filed an official plea to the local virus prevention headquarters to ease traffic controls so local farmers could buy feed and medicine, according to a document circulated online.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Qiu, who hoists a Chinese national flag next to his enormous chicken coops and wears a national flag badge on his black winter coat, said he wholeheartedly supported everything the Jiangsu government had done to combat the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But I also have real difficulties that require the government’s help,” he said.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

She began shielding herself from the virus as soon as she heard that someone affiliated with her campus — perhaps a student, perhaps an instructor, perhaps someone else — was one of six people confirmed to have the virus in the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At A.S.U., which has one of the largest student bodies in the country, students have been streaming into the campus health center in larger-than-usual numbers.

Who knows.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, six students who were recently in Wuhan arrived this month for classes and were told to self-monitor their health in their dorm rooms. Two of the students, who were natives of Wuhan, have been rooming with each other instead of with American students, as was originally planned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Melissa Gormley, dean of the college of liberal arts, said that the students had not showed any symptoms, and that she hoped to move the two from Wuhan into dorms with noninternational students soon.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the meantime, they have been free to rove about campus and attended the semester’s first day of classes on Monday. The incubation <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html" title="">period for the virus is about two weeks</a>, meaning people can appear healthy for some time after they are exposed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Gormley said she had met with all of the students who had traveled through Wuhan and tried to make them feel welcome.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We would do whatever we have to do to take care of our people in our community here, whether they were from Wuhan, whether they had traveled to Wuhan, or whether they were another student,” Ms. Gormley said. “And I hope they know that. But I can imagine that being an exchange student in this context would be really scary.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Students have described a rising anti-Chinese sentiment on their campuses that has extended to anyone of Asian descent. Some students have posted online about avoiding all Asian classmates or steering clear of Chinatowns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aaron Li, a senior at Cornell from China, said that he had created a form for Chinese students to anonymously submit concerns or questions about the virus and that one troubling response stuck out. It was from a student who said he had lied to his friends about spending winter break in California; he had actually returned home to China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was worried about what his friends would think,” Mr. Li said, adding that some Chinese students had to simultaneously worry about the health of family members back home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A campus satire publication <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://cunooz.com/2020/01/29/asian-student-asked-if-he-visited-wuhan-over-break/?fbclid=IwAR0AB-Abp_jit9ulG-V2vyuXwT6js9ANzfh6Mmpng2iyTFAZ1qtsjltuzd8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">dryly pushed back</a> against the rising sentiment with an article under the headline, “Asian Student Asked If He Visited Wuhan Over Break.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Charles Bui, 18, a freshman at the University of Houston, said he had scrolled past “dehumanizing” jokes online about the deadly virus and had personally seen people express relief after they stepped off an elevator with him.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The environment doesn’t feel the same as it used to, and so it’s unsettling,” said Mr. Bui, who is Vietnamese-American and plans to major in business. He added that he had sometimes questioned his own reactions, asking, “Is this really about my race or am I overassuming?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the University of California, Berkeley, which has a large Chinese student population, officials apologized after the university health center posted <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPjrc1YXsBgqTyF.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an image that included “xenophobia”</a> among a list of “common reactions” to the coronavirus. It was condemned as giving legitimacy to racism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the frenzy surrounding the virus grows, campus health officials are taking on two challenges: informing the public about the virus while managing exaggerated fears, and continuing to handle the flu viruses that typically spread this time of year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rachel Herman, the director of the Platteville school’s health center, said that members of her staff were in frequent contact with the local health department, but that they still consider influenza to be more concerning than the coronavirus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Stacie San Miguel, the director of medical services at the University of California, San Diego’s student health center, said students and others had been flocking to physicians for checkups.

The 14-day period is dated from when their plane left Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented health threat,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Friday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A federal quarantine order in the United States is rare; the last one was imposed in the 1960s, but it was limited.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Messonnier called the federal order on Friday “science-based,” saying it was warranted because of the worsening epidemic in China. She cited the widening, rapid spread of the disease there, the increase in person-to-person transmission and the rising death toll. In addition, evidence has been emerging that people can transmit the disease even before they show symptoms of the illness, which can cause pneumonia in severe cases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another concern was that the passengers evacuated had been in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. At a news conference later on Friday, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, announced that other citizens of the United States who were returning from Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, would also be quarantined for up to two weeks. Mr. Azar declared a public health emergency for the United States, and said foreign nationals who had been to China during the last 14 days would not be allowed into the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a very serious public health situation, and the C.D.C. and federal government have and will continue to take aggressive action to protect the public,” Dr. Messonnier said. “If we take strong measures now, we may be able to blunt” the impact of the virus in the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Messonnier said that the people who were quarantined did not pose a threat to the surrounding community.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since the 195 evacuees arrived in Riverside, they<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/coronavirus-americans-evacuate.html" title=""> have had their noses and throats swabbed</a> to test for the virus, and their temperatures taken several times a day. They were initially told that they would be detained for at least 72 hours, and possibly 14 days. Two weeks is thought to be the upper limit of the incubation period; if symptoms don’t start by then, a person can be cleared as not infected.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not all the virus tests have been completed, but even if the results are negative, that does not mean a person is not infected, Dr. Messonnier said. It is possible to test too early for the virus, so a person who tests negative could still become ill and infect others. Therefore, officials said it was safer to detain people for the entire incubation period.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the C.D.C.’s global migration and quarantine division, said the evacuees would benefit from the quarantine, which would prevent them from infecting their families and would provide close monitoring so that they could receive medical treatment quickly if symptoms developed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Citing quarantines in Toronto during the SARS outbreak there in 2003, he said that most people being quarantined accept it as “part of their civic responsibility to protect their community,” once they understand the reasons. He also said that many people flown home from Wuhan were diplomats who understood this as part of their duty.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until Friday, the evacuees’ detention at the air base had been unofficial. The group had stayed voluntarily for testing, except for one member, who tried to leave on Wednesday and was quarantined by Riverside County.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federal law <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">authorizes the C.D.C. to impose quarantines</a>, but the power is rarely used. The last large-scale quarantine was imposed during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19. The limited one in the 1960s that Dr. Cetron mentioned involved a possible case of smallpox.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, China took the extreme measure of halting public transit and imposing a quarantine on Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. But people were already traveling extensively in and out of the country for celebrations of the Lunar New Year, prompting concerns that the virus would spread widely around the globe.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">six people in the United States</a> are known to be infected. Five had been to Wuhan and the sixth is the husband of one of those patients. He had not traveled to Wuhan, but contracted the illness from his wife after she returned home to Chicago. The other cases have been in Washington State, California and Arizona.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than 100 people in 36 states are being monitored as “patients under investigation,” because they have symptoms like fever and cough and had been to Wuhan or in contact with patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hundreds of other contacts of patients have been told to notify doctors or health officials immediately if they become ill.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the briefing, Dr. Messonnier cited a new report from Germany as part of the evidence that pushed the C.D.C. to impose the quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Physicians there who identified the first coronavirus case in their country have reported that the patient was infected by a colleague visiting from China who was not yet sick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That the disease may be transmitted before infected people show symptoms will make the disease harder to contain, experts said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A letter published in the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">New England Journal of Medicine said the German patient was</a> a healthy 33-year-old businessman who developed a sore throat, chills and muscle aches on Jan. 24, with a fever spiking to 102.4 the next day, along with a cough. He felt better a day later and returned to work on Jan. 27.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before he became ill, he had met with a Chinese business partner from his company near Munich, on Jan. 20 and 21. She was a resident of Shanghai who had been in Germany from Jan. 19 to 22. Though she was healthy during the visit, she got sick during her flight back to China, where she tested positive for the new coronavirus on Jan. 26. She informed her company, which traced her contacts to alert anyone she might have exposed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The businessman was contacted, and although he was already recovering, he tested positive for the virus.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Jan. 28, three more employees of the company in Germany tested positive for the coronavirus, only one of whom had contact with the woman from Shanghai. The others were apparently infected by their male colleague, before he developed symptoms. All of them were admitted to the hospital, where they were isolated and monitored, and none have developed severe symptoms.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authors of the letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, who are from Munich and Berlin, said it was “notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period” of the woman from Shanghai, who shortly afterward had only a brief, mild illness.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It does mean that transmission is more readily achieved than it was in SARS,” an earlier coronavirus disease, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “The report from Germany indicates quite conclusively that spread during the incubation period when the person is not sick themselves can take place.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, he added, “We don’t know how frequently it happens.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a kind of natural experiment, where people were nicely shown to be in a chain of transmission, and it sounds very, very plausible,” Dr. Schaffner said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A scientific paper about the first patient in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus revealed more details about the course the illness takes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The patient, a 35-year-old from Snohomish County, Wash., returned to the United States on Jan. 15 from a visit to Wuhan, and developed a cough and fever as soon as he got home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After reading about the latest coronavirus in news reports, he sought medical treatment and informed his health care providers about his travel, although he had not been to an animal market or had contact with sick people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was tested and sent home, but was called back in on Jan. 20 when the test came back positive. He was hospitalized in an isolation unit on Jan. 21, and was still in the hospital on Thursday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Washington resident did not become severely ill until nine days after his symptoms started. An X-ray then revealed pneumonia, and he received an experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir on a compassionate basis, for which the Food and Drug Administration allows use of a drug not yet approved.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the 12th day of his illness, he no longer had symptoms, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191?query=RP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">description of his case published</a> on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

As they passed time on the March Air Reserve Base, waiting until they can be cleared to leave by medical officials, some recalled unsettling, eerie final days in Wuhan and a jarring scene as the plane finally carried them away.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was surreal,” said Matthew McCoy, a theme-park designer, recalling the airplane crew members in hazardous material suits tending to passengers in masks. “They were trying to keep us calm, but they had these guys covered from head to toe taking your temperature. It felt like a C.I.A. cargo plane.”</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">How Is the U.S. Being Affected?</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb.10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To contain the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 200 people and infected thousands, people have been quarantined on a cruise ship, in hospital wards and on an island.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Late Wednesday, hours after the plane arrived in California, a passenger tried to leave the base and was intercepted, local officials in Riverside County said. A quarantine order was issued to that passenger, a spokeswoman for the county said, because of “the unknown risks to the public should someone leave the base without undergoing a full health evaluation.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With ample time on their hands, the passengers performed mundane tasks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m working out, watching movies, eating well,” said Jarred Evans, 27, a football player from New York City who has been living in Wuhan for two years, where he plays for the Chinese National Football League champions, the Wuhan Berserkers. He has also been through numerous checks. “I’ve never had my temperature taken so many times in my life,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From his room at an inn on the military base, Mr. McCoy said, “It’s not Club Med, but we’re fortunate to be here. I try to stay busy with my work, social media and my hotel workout regimen.” The Spanish-style hotel, which boasts stucco archways and a large courtyard, faces a verdant lawn.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a stopover in Anchorage for refueling and medical screening, the passengers were greeted in California by experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who conducted medical tests and offered psychological counseling. Noses and throats were swabbed. Blood was drawn. Temperatures were taken, again.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some recalled bleak, sometimes terrifying, last days in Wuhan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Evans, a former quarterback at the University of Cincinnati, moved to Wuhan when he was recruited to play for the city’s American football team.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It had been a good season: His team had won the national championship in Shanghai on Jan. 8.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I fell in love with Chinese culture,” he said, “and I got to be the face of American football in China.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But when the coronavirus began spreading through Wuhan, Mr. Evans shut himself inside his apartment, stocked up with rice, noodles, eggs and disinfectant.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I did exactly what every Chinese person did,” he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I locked myself in. The city turned into a ghost town,” Mr. Evans said. But he felt isolated, he said, and his mother, back in the United States, was worried for his safety.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When he heard of a flight out of the country, he quickly filled out the online forms. An email from the United States Embassy in Beijing arrived, which read: “Space on this flight is extremely limited and we respectfully request that you not share details regarding the flight, including on social media.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Evans learned that he was No. 171 on a flight that could accommodate about 200, he said. “I felt very lucky to be chosen out of all U.S. residents in Wuhan,” he said. Some Americans reported that they had tried to get a seat on the flight but were told there was no room.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. McCoy, who lives in Shanghai, was in Wuhan working on a mall he is refashioning into a theme park when he got caught in the lockdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The atmosphere in the city was “just short of panic,” he recalled.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A former Marine who has run 12 marathons and stays in good shape, Mr. McCoy said he was convinced he had not contracted the virus. But he still took the outbreak seriously. He decided it was worth plunking down $1,100 for a one-way ticket to the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the American group left Wuhan, it had been made aware it would have to remain in an isolated location for at least 72 hours.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This quarantine will occur for a minimum of 72 hours and may extend through 14 days or may be followed by conditional release with health monitoring,” said an email that he received before the flight. Mr. McCoy said that had not troubled most people. “Everyone was cool with that. We are trying to be patriots, trying to help,” he said. “We’re a captive audience here.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday morning, their first full day back in the United States, the group downed breakfast burritos, juice and coffee. For lunch, they received a hearty taco salad with chicken. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An invitation slipped under the doors of the hotel rooms promised a “town hall discussion.” Federal health officials urged the group to remain on the base until receiving full medical clearance.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now it was a matter of waiting.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside, there were refreshments, chips, cookies and toys. Scooters, footballs, soccer balls and Frisbees were available.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People here have been really nice,” Mr. Evans said. “Everybody is in great spirits.

The United States on Friday also declared the coronavirus, which has sickened nearly 12,000 people and has spread to the United States and other countries, a public health emergency.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Friday’s action exempts immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition, officials said, any United States citizen returning home who has been in the Hubei province of China within the past 14 days will be quarantined for up to 14 days. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those who have been to other parts of China within the past 14 days will be subject to “proactive entry screening” and up to 14 days of monitoring and self quarantine.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States will also funnel all flights from China to just a few airports, including Kennedy Airport, Chicago’s O’Hare and San Francisco International Airport.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The travel restrictions were announced Friday by Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, who declared that the coronavirus posed “a public health emergency in the United States.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the actions were being taken because there were “a lot of unknowns” surrounding the virus and its transmission path.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The number of cases have steeply inclined with every day,” Dr. Fauci said.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-66f879b9">Stocks sink again after airlines cancel flights to China.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The broadening outbreak has roiled stock markets and raised alarms about possible harm to global economic growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The S&amp;P 500 suffered its sharpest decline of the year on Friday after major airlines in the United States said they would cancel flights to and from mainland China. It was the worst daily decline since October, and pushed the markets into negative territory for the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The cancellations by Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines were the latest example of economic disruption wrought by the coronavirus, just as the global economy had begun to recover from the trade war tensions that dominated 2019. Companies have restricted travel to the region, shut stores in China and warned of the possible financial impact.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists seem certain that the travel shutdowns, factory closures and quarantines in mainland China will dampen economic activity there, but have said it is too soon to know the impact elsewhere.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is a wild card — I think even the experts would confirm that it’s too soon to tell,” said Richard Clarida, the vice chair of the Federal Reserve, during an interview on Friday on Bloomberg Television. The Fed is “monitoring closely,” he said.</p>, <h2 class="css-zd32qr">How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key Factors</h2>, <p class="css-1uuihdo">Here’s what early research says about how the pathogen behaves and the factors that will determine whether it can be contained.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Concerns about global growth sent oil prices down below $52 a barrel. That pushed shares of energy companies down: Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropped by roughly 4 percent. Tech stocks also suffered, with particular weakness in the semiconductor sector, which is closely linked to supply chains based in and around China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists have only begun to sketch out estimates on the potential effects of the outbreak. Many have taken comfort from the economic record of the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 and 2003, which suggests that any downturn might be limited in scope. SARS coincided with a relatively brief slowdown of global growth in early 2003, that was followed by a sharp rebound.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS, however, is an imperfect comparison. Some economists have suggested the ripple effects could be larger this time. At the time of the SARS outbreak, China represented just 5 percent of the global economy. In 2019, that number was 18 percent, according to JPMorgan economists.</p>, <h2 class="css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40" id="link-577f2f0a">Delta, United and American Airlines are suspending all flights between the U.S. and mainland China.</h2>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines all said on Friday that they were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/travel/travel-coronavirus-airlines.html" title="">suspending all service to mainland China</a> as concerns about the coronavirus spread internationally.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">American said it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China immediately through March 27. American and United will continue flights to Hong Kong.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Delta and United said they would suspend service starting on Feb. 6. United said it expected to resume operations on March 28.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Delta, which does not fly to Hong Kong, said it would suspend service through April 30. Delta said in a statement that its last flight to mainland China from the United States would depart on Monday, and that its last flight to the United States from mainland China would leave on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Delta was the first American airline to completely suspend service to China because of the virus. United Airlines had already reduced its service to the country this week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Share prices in all three airlines had fallen by midday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Airlines outside the United States are also clamping down on travel. In Rwanda and Kenya, RwandAir and Kenya Airways said they would cancel all flights to and from Guangzhou, the southern Chinese metropolis, until further notice. There have been no confirmed cases in Africa.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Poland’s national airline, LOT Polish Airlines, has suspended flights to China until Feb. 9, a<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/MAPGOVPL/status/1223219993556455425" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> deputy prime minister said on Twitter.</a> More than a dozen people suspected of having the coronavirus are hospitalized in Poland, and over 500 people are being monitored by health services.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Iran has suspended all flights to China because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Reuters. Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported on Friday that all flights from China to the Islamic Republic have also been banned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several Canadian companies have suspended employee travel to China after Air Canada’s decision on Wednesday to suspend service to Shanghai and Beijing.

That episode was ultimately found to be a false alarm.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Germany, the Bavarian state Health Ministry confirmed a sixth case of the virus on Friday — the first child to be infected in the country.

They include widespread strikes in France, political confusion in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/europe/italy-election-Salvini.html" title="">Italy</a> and slumping world trade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/world/europe/brexit-remainers.html" title="">Brexit hasn’t helped</a>. With the future terms of cross-channel trade still to be negotiated, some businesses may be hesitant to hire new workers or spend money on expansion.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is one of the uncertainties weighing on investment,” said Rosie Colthorpe, European economist at Oxford Economics in London. “It’s still quite uncertain what both sides want.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Growth at the end of the year was significantly slower than during previous quarters. The eurozone countries grew just 1.2 percent during 2019, according to a preliminary estimate by Eurostat, the European Union’s official statistics agency. The bloc as a whole, which includes countries that aren’t in the eurozone, like Sweden, Poland and Romania, grew 1.4 percent.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The specter of recession is back,” Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to investors on Friday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html" title="">coronavirus is another big unknown</a>. China is a major customer for German cars and other European products. A slowdown in China would spill over to the eurozone. Europeans are also nervous that President Trump could follow through on threats to put punitive tariffs on cars manufactured there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Output in Italy, Europe’s most troubled big economy, unexpectedly shrank 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Italian growth was zero, signaling more of the stagnation that has plagued the country for more than a decade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/world/europe/what-is-brexit.html" title="">Brexit</a> has already hurt trade between Britain and the rest of Europe. Germany missed out on about 16.2 billion euros, or $18 billion, in exports to Britain because of Brexit, according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, which measured how much more Germany would have sold to Britain if trade had remained as high as it was in 2015, before the Brexit referendum.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some economists expressed optimism that the fourth quarter of 2019 was a low point and that European growth will begin to recover. Only a few months ago, Britain appeared to be headed for a disorderly exit from the European Union. That danger, at least, seems to be past.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">France, where the economy <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/4300183" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">unexpectedly shrank 0.1 percent</a> in the fourth quarter, could bounce back now that the strikes that paralyzed transportation have largely ended.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unemployment in the eurozone, at 7.4 percent in December, is at its lowest since before the financial crisis began in 2008, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10159296/3-30012020-AP-EN.pdf/b9a98100-6917-c3ea-a544-ce288ac09675" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">figures released Thursday</a>. When people have jobs, they spend more money and contribute to growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our hope is that the fourth quarter marks the bottom,” Ms. Colthorpe of Oxford Economics said. “We are little bit positive about 2020. But with uncertainties about Brexit and so forth it’s not going to be a massive rebound.”</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]

Planning was upended for companies across a vast global supply chain, from Apple to John Deere, the tractor company.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The S&amp;P 500 suffered its worst loss since October, falling 1.8 percent, as the spread of the virus — and the increasingly urgent efforts by companies and governments to contain it — fanned fears of an economic slowdown.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government travel restrictions, which will take effect on Sunday evening, were announced by Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, who declared that the coronavirus posed “a public health emergency in the United States.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The administration’s action will restrict all foreign nationals who have been to China in the past 14 days from entering the United States. The restriction does not include immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents. Nearly three million Chinese residents traveled to the United States in 2018, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2017-I-001/index.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">federal data based on travel records</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The travel restrictions and the airline’s announcements showed how rapidly concerns about the virus have escalated into a grave test of the global economy, for which there is no recent precedent. Three weeks after the first virus-related death was reported, China has found itself increasingly cut off from its biggest trading partner, the United States, and many other nations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese officials said on Saturday that there had been an additional 46 deaths in the country, the most so far in a 24-hour period, raising the death toll to 259. It said confirmed infections had grown to nearly 12,000, from 1,300 a week earlier.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 100 cases have been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-city.html" title="">confirmed across 21 other countries</a>, including seven reported cases in the United States. Russia, Italy and Britain each reported their first infections on Friday, two from each country. The four patients in Italy and Russia were Chinese citizens, the authorities there said; Britain did not release any details.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To address the outbreak, China has extended the Lunar New Year holiday, which was to have ended Thursday, into next week. In cities across the country, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">including those far from the center of the outbreak</a>, there were eerie scenes Friday of all-but-empty streets and highways, closed shops, trains without passengers and nearly deserted public spaces that are normally packed.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 10, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The slowdown in activity has raised fears that essential supplies, including food, will run short, which the government insists it will not allow to happen.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And it is unclear when China’s economic engine — a huge producer of both consumer goods and industrial components — might return to anything resembling normal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many companies said they were relatively well positioned for the disruption, thanks in part to the recent easing of the trade tensions between China and the United States. Faced with the threat of tariffs, many companies — particularly retailers — had stocked up on imports from China, or found suppliers in other parts of Asia.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if the restrictions in China are kept in place for many months and the virus keeps spreading, profits will suffer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Forsake, a footwear company based in Boston, has most of its supply chain and production facility in Zhongshan in southeastern China. The company received its spring orders before the annual holiday closing and is stocked through July. After that, said Sam Barstow, the president and chief operating officer, who knows?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t really know what we’re planning for,” Mr. Barstow said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said on an earnings call this week that many of its suppliers’ factories in China would remain closed until Feb. 10.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apple had closed one retail store in China, and said traffic into its stores across China had decreased in recent days. Apple is frequently “deep cleaning” its stores and regularly checking the temperature of its employees there, Mr. Cook said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The airlines are also braced for prolonged turmoil. American said all of its flights between the United States and mainland China were being suspended immediately, through March 27.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">United and Delta said their flights on those routes would be suspended by next Thursday. United said it expected to resume operations on March 28, while Delta said its suspension would last through April 30. The three airlines accounted for more than a third of all travel between China and the United States in 2018.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2018, more than 8.5 million passengers traveled between the United States and China, according to data from the United States Transportation Department. Most flew on a handful of Chinese airlines, none of which immediately responded to requests for comment Friday on any plans to halt or modify service.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The coronavirus has already sickened more people than the outbreak of the SARS virus did in the eight-month outbreak of 2002 and 2003.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SARS outbreak coincided with a relatively brief slowdown of global growth in early 2003, which was followed by a sharp rebound.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SARS, however, is an imperfect comparison because at the time China represented just 5 percent of the global economy. In 2019, China accounted for about 18 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase economists.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The much larger role of China in the global economy versus 2003 implies much greater global spillover risks,” the bank wrote in a research note on Friday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, the JPMorgan Chase economists cut their forecast for Chinese economic growth sharply for the first quarter to incorporate the impact of the virus. They now expect that the Chinese economy will grow at an annualized rate of 4.9 percent in the first quarter, down from the 6.3 percent pace they previously predicted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new forecasts reflect the expectation of sharp decelerations in retail sales, industrial production and business investment. But the forecast also calls for a strong rebound in economic activity in the second quarter, as the impact of the outbreak dissipates.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Concerns about global growth have pushed the benchmark American oil price below $52 a barrel, from more than $60 at the start of the year, and have sent the shares of energy companies lower. Tech stocks have also suffered, with particular weakness in the semiconductor sector, which is closely linked to supply chains based in and around China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, the State Department raised its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/Coronavirus-travel-advisory-.html" title="">travel advisory</a> to Level 4 — “Do not travel” — a rating reserved for situations in which the government expects to have very limited ability to help citizens abroad. The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency because of the spreading virus, though it opposed restrictions on travel or trade with China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Azar, the United States health secretary, and other members of a Trump administration task force emphasized on Friday that the current risk to the American public from the coronavirus was low.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the drastic travel restriction suggested that the risks in the United States could grow quickly and unpredictably.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a Washington briefing that the actions were being taken because there were “a lot of unknowns” surrounding the virus and its transmission path. Unlike influenza, which is fairly predictable in terms of infection and mortality, Dr. Fauci said there was not the same certainty about the rate and path of the coronavirus transmission.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The number of cases have steeply inclined with every day,” Dr. Fauci said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to the restrictions on foreign nationals traveling from China, the United States will begin funneling all flights from China to just a few airports, including Kennedy International in New York, O’Hare in Chicago and San Francisco International.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials said any American citizen returning to the United States from the Hubei Province in China, where the outbreak is centered, would be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine. Any American returning to the country who has visited the rest of mainland China within the last 14 days will undergo proactive health screening at selective ports of entry.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/health/quarantine-coronavirus.html" title="">imposed a two-week quarantine</a> on 195 people who were evacuated on Wednesday from Wuhan, China, to a California military base.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some public health and policy experts said the restrictions announced Friday, weeks after the virus was discovered in China, might not do as much officials hoped in containing the contagion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At this point, sharply curtailing air travel to and from China is more of an emotional or political reaction, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The cow’s already out of the barn,” he said, ”and we’re now talking about shutting the barn door.”</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Reporting was contributed by Matt Phillips, Patricia Cohen, Niraj Chokshi, Jack Nicas, Knvul Sheikh, Russell Goldman, Chris Buckley, Elaine Yu, Richard C.

I report on tech policy from The Times’s bureau in Washington. But this past week, one of the biggest stories began with an announcement an ocean away.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For weeks, we had been waiting to see whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson would allow Huawei equipment to be used in Britain’s 5G wireless network or follow American officials in shutting the company out. The United States has said for years that the company’s networking gear could give the Chinese government access to key infrastructure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, Mr. Johnson <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/britain-huawei-5G.html" title="">revealed his decision</a>: Huawei is in. The company’s equipment can be used in a portion of the 5G, or fifth-generation, network.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a big setback for the Trump administration’s global anti-Huawei push. The White House had sent top officials to London to try to sway Mr. Johnson, a close ally. Shortly after the British announcement, the European Union <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/europe/eu-huawei-5g.html" title="">told its members</a> to limit but not totally eliminate Huawei’s role in their network.</p>, <h1 class="g-headline" id="g-inlineguide-headline">The Coronavirus Outbreak</h1>, <h2 class="g-inlineguide-list-header g-optimize-type">What do you need to know? Start here.</h2>, <p class="g-inlineguide-date">Updated Feb. 5, 2020</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I messaged Adam Satariano, who covers tech in Europe from The Times’s London bureau, to find out more about the fallout from Mr. Johnson’s choice.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Why did Boris Johnson make the decision to allow Huawei to stay involved in building Britain’s 5G network, despite all the pressure he was under from the Trump administration?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are a few key reasons. First, a practical one. Huawei has been part of the British telecom network for years. 5G will be built on top of that existing system. To implement a ban now would be extraordinarily costly and delay the rollout of the faster network because a lot of that old kit would have to be ripped out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, British intelligence and cybersecurity officials believe the risks of Huawei can be mitigated. As part of allowing Huawei to be part of its network, British officials years ago required the company to subject its products and code to tests. There’s a lab near Cambridge where this is done. For British officials, this gives them a level of confidence that the problem can be managed. Of course, American officials think this is wishful thinking. With 5G, software plays a much bigger role, meaning it will be harder to keep harmful code from slipping through.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, as Britain exits the European Union, it can’t afford to alienate China, which is a big investor in the country and a growing buyer of British exports. From an economic standpoint, it would be a big risk. Britain also sees 5G as a key to the country’s economic future, and any delays could put it at a disadvantage to other countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Here in Washington, Mr. Johnson’s decision set off a paroxysm of concerned statements from the administration and hawkish members of Congress. What has the reaction been like in Britain?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I think it was expected. The statement from the White House was actually quite mild. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still went forward with a trip to Britain during the week. Perhaps harsher words were shared behind closed doors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">This Huawei decision is also just one example of a split between how tech is regulated in the United States and in Britain. What’s the future of the special relationship when it comes to tech?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Complicated. Like many countries in Europe, Britain is very frustrated with Big Tech. It doesn’t think the companies pay their fair share in taxes. And with Facebook and Google/YouTube, not enough is done to limit the spread of harmful content. Attempts to address taxes and harmful content will gain momentum this year, potentially setting up more tension with the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">It’s late in London, so I’ve got just one more: You cover all of Europe, not just Britain. Where does the American campaign to keep Huawei out of 5G networks go next?</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Germany is another country where the United States has been applying a lot of pressure. But as our colleagues Katrin Bennhold and Jack Ewing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/world/europe/huawei-germany-china-5g-automakers.html" title="">recently reported</a>, it also faces a tough decision. China has threatened to retaliate if Huawei is banned. That is not an insignificant threat for Germany, which sells a lot of BMWs and VWs to China.

When I walk through our Phoenix hospital’s emergency department, I’m reminded of the global outbreak we really should be worried about: influenza.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We are at a high point in the flu season, with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/us-flu-cases-climb-to-15-million-with-54-pediatric-deaths-recorded-in-201920-season" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">15 million cases</a>, 140,000 hospitalizations, and 8,200 deaths in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every day dozens of people with flu symptoms come through our emergency department.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coronavirus is a serious disease, and we must be vigilant in monitoring its spread while working to find solutions. But at this writing, there have been only a handful of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in this country, mostly in recent travelers to Wuhan, China. Rather than rushing out to buy masks and fretting over the unlikely chance of contracting the coronavirus, Americans should get their flu shots, and wash their hands often to avoid the flu.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Michael D.

PM 2.5 refers to particles of pollution that are small enough to pass through the lung and enter the bloodstream, causing damage to the immune system as well as other organ systems, such as the lungs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thus far, it appears that the virus produces a severe infection primarily in those with weakened lungs and immune systems, such as the elderly, diabetics and smokers. One important consideration is that the citizens of Wuhan are exposed to unusually high levels of PM 2.5, typically 20 times the current “acceptable” limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The virus is likely to be less lethal in less polluted areas of the world.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the Environmental Protection Agency relaxes air quality standards, we should be mindful of the broad benefits of a breath of fresh air.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Peter Muennig<br/>New York<br/><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The writer is a professor of health policy and management at Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">To the Editor:</strong></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Re “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/27china-coronavirus-health.html" title="">Feeble Health System in China Strains to Combat Deadly Virus</a>” (front page, Jan. 28):</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Your article describing the Chinese health system as being “feeble” in its ability to deal with the coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan depicts an overwhelmed medical infrastructure in China. Sadly, in the event of a pandemic, our hospitals would be similarly overwhelmed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the anthrax scare in 2001, my hospital held a medical staff meeting to review emergency procedures if there were an outbreak in Philadelphia. It was sobering to hear how few excess intensive care unit beds and even hospital beds were available in our city for an outbreak of anthrax due to bioterrorism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Apparently, in the event of a public health disaster, the supply of antibiotics available to a large city is limited to a few days. We were told that all vacant hospital beds would be filled in days, and patients would be boarded in the hallways. Also, excess ventilator capacity was fairly limited, and that in short order, no ventilators would be available to support critically ill patients.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time of 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, we had a similar sobering review of our capacity to handle a widespread outbreak.

That is not so reassuring."</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">    </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW DEADLY IS IT?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases, he said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">      </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In emerging infectious disease outbreaks, the most serious cases are identified first. Coronavirus infections can range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe cases that cause pneumonia, acute respiratory illness and death.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 20% of confirmed cases in the China coronavirus outbreak are classified as severe, similar to SARS and MERS, Schaffner said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW INFECTIOUS IS IT?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The previously unknown strain is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within weeks it appeared capable of being transmitted from one person to another via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than SARS," said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's University of Nottingham. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The incubation period is estimated between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of "symptomless spreading" by someone who is infected but unaware of it. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London, says that is too early to know if so-called "super-spreader" events seen with MERS and SARS is happening with the new coronavirus.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">    </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">         </span></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOW ARE COUNTRIES RESPONDING?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some 60 million people are under virtual lockdown in China's Hubei province – of which Wuhan is the capital. Australia, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia are quarantining evacuees from China for at least two weeks. Many global airlines have suspended or scaled back direct flights to China's major cities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts say China has been more forthcoming with information than it was during its 2003 SARS outbreak, but there are still concerns about how much data they are sharing. Some also questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine attempt on millions of people.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">"That kind of thing can backfire. It can make it harder to get resources in," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Graphic - Tracking the novel coronavirus: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> (Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles and Kate Kelland in London; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Lisa Shumaker)</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd" id="site-index-label">Site Index</h2>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-0">news</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-1">opinion</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-2">arts</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-3">living</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-section-label-4">more</h3>, <h3 class="css-rxqrcl" id="site-index-subscribe-label">Subscribe</h3>, <h2 class="css-vz7hjd">Site Information Navigation</h2>]
